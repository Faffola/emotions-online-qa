As a result, a large number of the department seminars that get hosted are on topics that I have little or no background in and do not relate to my research field in any way.</p>

<p>The expectation seems to be that everyone should go to these type of events to stay abreast of major events and gain some breadth of knowledge, but whenever I go to one that is far outside my sphere of knowledge I end up resenting the wasted time.  To me, it seems like a huge waste to sit through a 60 minute talk on something I don't have the background knowledge necessary to understand in even a rudimentary way.  Sometimes this is the fault of the presenter for not preparing a talk for a broad enough audience, but with biology talks I know that the fault is my own.  Don't ask me the difference between a protein and an amino acid; I have no idea!</p>

<p>I aim to closely read and summarize 5 pages per day and skim a few other abstracts besides that.  I spend about half my time looking at data and figures which doesn't contribute to my daily ""page count.""  When I'm reading about a new topic these five pages can take several hours, but on topics I have more background in five pages might only take an hour per day.</p>

<p>I guess since everybody defines ""read"" in a different way it's hard to get an objective answer about how much reading is enough.  How much people read seems like a bit of a sensitive topic among real-life colleagues because everyone has a bit of anxiety that they aren't reading enough.  But for those further along in their academic path, I'd like to hear how you approached the literature early in your graduate school career and what you think is a sufficient amount.</p>

<p>I guess this all distills down into two main topics:</p>

<p><strong>When deciding what to read each day, should I focus on depth or breadth?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is five pages of close reading per day enough?</strong>  I know it doesn't sound like much, but it takes significant mental energy to meet that goal.  And consistently reading 5 pages per day adds up to a lot over time.</p>

<p><strong>Edited to add:</strong> I mostly read about petrology, volcanology, structural geology, and tectonics if that makes a difference.  By ""page"" I mean ""page of text"" so if I'm reading a structural geology paper with lots of maps and figures I discount for those and a ""ten page"" paper becomes a 5 page paper for my purposes.</p>

<p>For instance, I've read on some forums (I can't locate the link now) that while considering prospective applications for tenure-track faculty positions, very few Universities accept a candidate who has completed his/her Ph.D from a lower ranked school having a lesser ""brand"" value, irrespective of the fact whether he/she has published equally original work as his/her counterpart from an Ivy league college. How much truth is in this statement? It would be really great if someone already in academia, either as a newly-accepted faculty or someone on the Faculty Hiring committee could share their experiences/statistics on this regard.

Just so that I'm clear, I'm only trying to calibrate the applicant's expectations about the working style of his potential adviser - and hence need to know to what extent are the following ""typical"" assumptions valid.</p>

<p><strong>Tenured professor</strong></p>

<p>A full professor is more likely to get grant funding, hence less time spent on TAship - but could also mean less time/effort spent on interactions with students (either being busy with other projects/talks, or due to more commitments to family at that age).</p>

<p><strong>Tenure-track faculty (Assistant profs)</strong></p>

<p>More likely to be young and energetic, and could translate to more time spent on one-to-one discussions with grad students - but funding may prove to be an issue, and may have to be on TA for a longer period.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What other factors would be relevant in this matter, and to what extent am I correct/incorrect in either the factors considered, or for undertaking this exercise at all? </p>

159,"<p>Following on from <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/q/149/96"">What is a &quot;Sandwich thesis&quot;?</a> , is there an easy way to find out which departments at which universities will allow a sandwich thesis (aka a <em>stapler thesis</em>, <em>portfolio thesis</em>, <em>three-paper thesis</em>, <em>thesis by portfolio of publications</em>, <em>thesis by publication</em>, <em>article thesis</em> or <em>compilation thesis</em>)?</p>

<p>That is to say, universities that explicitly allow PhDs theses that consist of a collection of published or in-press articles, possibly topped and tailed by an introduction and summary? It is, to my knowledge, quite rare in the UK - does it perhaps tend to be a country-specific thing?</p>

<p>I accept that it will depend on the supervisor's approval too, but that's a secondary issue: the supervisor can't allow a stapler thesis if the university/department does not. My question is about identifying eligible departments.</p>

<p>In most (if not all) PhD programs, incoming grad students are supposed to take relevant courses and fulfill their TA-ship duties (I'm assuming not everyone gets a RA from the 1st semester itself). During that time, they are also expected (and highly encouraged) to keep reading on their chosen research field, to have a concrete idea of where all the focus in that field is at that moment. </p>

the primary qualifications (>90% of fellowships in US require the

Part of the reason I want to do that is to be able to eventually apply for a Ph.D. program in a good school, and having publications would be a great thing on my resume.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to find out is how I can work on a research project similar to those graduate students work on as a part of their studies if I'm not a student anymore? Should I contact my old professors from the university? Is it possible to find some ""open research"" team that accepts collaborators from outside? Do I have to do it on my own (quite frankly I'm not sure I can give myself a good enough quick-start)? In short, I'm willing to volunteer my time in exchange for a possibility of publication in the future. Can I do it, and if yes then how?</p>

317,"<p>I keep hearing different things from different people and it seems there is no clear policy laid out at my institution regarding the definition of graduate student vacation days; I'm curious how PIs and students handle this issue at other places.  </p>

<p><strong>At your institution, do University-wide holidays (such as ""Spring Break"" or ""Winter Recess / Christmas holiday"") count towards a graduate student's two weeks vacation?</strong>  I always thought the expectation was just that you should be working most of the time, regardless of what day it is, and that seems reasonable to me as long as students have flexibility to take leave when they want/need to without somebody nagging them about the specifics of when/how much time off.  </p>

<p>However, recently there's been the assertion by certain bean-counting PIs in my department that students should be working 6 days a week (including nights) and only taking 2 weeks of leave in total (including major holidays).  Most people probably work about this much anyway, but being told that it's required leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  If people want to get really specific about the ""number"" of days worked/not-worked, there should be a more standard definition of what comprises a work day (i.e. 9-5, not 9am-12pm).  <strong>Am I way out of line here?</strong></p>

(See edit below for an explanation of the process) </p>

<p>I'd rather not take that experience off my CV, as it explains why my undergraduate degree is taking so long (I was working for a semester instead of taking classes), and my supervisor did offer me a good reference letter, since I was a good worker, despite the fact I didn't get great results.

<p>EDIT: An explanation of how applying for summer jobs tends to work in my experience:
I'm an undergraduate chemistry major applying to be a research assistant over the summer. The general process for this is you find a professor doing the type of research you want, and email them your coverletter and CV. If they like you then they either hire you, or apply for a grant to get funding to hire you. Formal or informal interviews can take place at any time during this process, depending on how the professor likes to operate. Formal job descriptions are usually only placed on the grant after the student applies, it isn't listed on the profs website beforehand. Therefore I've applied to several synthetic chemistry groups then been either told I'll be expected to do some modelling as part of my job, or asked if I would be willing to do such research: The second option isn't so bad, but the first is rather awarded to explain, doubly so if I'm not told of this until after the grant is already awarded.</p>

417,"<p>The question is hypothetical, but it came up in a conversation and I'd like to see if we can come up with a logical analysis and conclusion. For various reasons, <em>graduate students</em> might not be inclined to apply for funding. </p>

<p>By <em>funding</em> I mean grants or scholarships intended to support graduate students directly in the form of money given <em>directly</em> to the student. That is, I am <em>not</em> talking about applying for research scholarships intended to fund an experiment, buy equipment, etc. Here are a few (made up) examples.</p>

<p><em><strong>Case 1 (Differential)</strong></em>. I get 20000 of internal departmental funding but be encouraged by the department to apply for external funding. If I then get 5000 scholarship, then the departmental policy might be to drop the internal funding to 15000, so I don't apply for it.</p>

<p><em><strong>Case 2 (Rich Student)</strong></em>. I am very wealthy and I have no need for funding. I am a brilliant student and could probably get many different scholarships but I chose not to because I feel other students with less money need the money more.</p>

<p>The ""Rich Student"" scenario is slightly different than the ""Differential"" scenario. If I am rich then for sure some other poorer student could have gotten the money, whereas in the ""Differential"" scenario, I am now only getting 15000 so another student will get the 5000 anyway.</p>

<p>The problem with not applying for scholarships is that I don't get scholarships, and in many fields winning scholarships is good for your academic career. Perhaps in some fields this is more important than others.</p>

<p>Overwhelmingly I've heard that one should always apply for scholarships regardless of circumstances because of this. Of course theoretically, I could bypass my ""rich student morality"" by using it to do something useful for the community.</p>

<p>Personally, although I am not in these situations, I feel that it is most beneficial to always apply for scholarships, I would just like to have some kind of evidence that support this.</p>

<p><strong>So to put this in a definitive question: for graduate students, is there ever a reason not to apply for at least a few available scholarships?</strong></p>

422,"<p>More than once, I have had (graduate school admissions) orientation sessions where the faculty of the institute introduce their fields, their research and what they expect from potential students (Among other things). </p>

<p>At places I am interested in, this is a useful exercise. However, there are often places which I don't wish to study at but have a few good professors doing some really good work with great knowledge of the field and awesome intuition.</p>

<p><strong>How does one fully exploit an opportunity to interact with good professors from institutes you are not interested in attending?</strong></p>

<p>This is very different from a <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/223/how-can-i-get-the-most-out-of-conferences"">research conference</a> for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Further,</p>

428,"<p>Looking at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_ranks"">list of academic ranks</a> on Wikipedia shows that the same academic rank/title can mean quite different things in different countries.

<p>My question is not about where I should continue my education. My question is about how exactly should I search for the place to study for my master's degree. I simply don't know where should I start. I don't know what my first step should be. I don't have any experience living abroad.</p>

<p>Right now in order to choose the place I consider just few parameters.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I am interested in algorithms, almost every university that offers master degree in computer science would be an appropriate choice.</p></li>
<li><p>Fee. It's really a problem. I didn't find universities in Europe that offer master's degree study for free, few of them offer applying for scholarship. But I am not sure I have a good chance to get one, and obviously it doesn't cover all fee. I don't have citizenship in a European country so I assume It's gonna be harder to apply. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>What's your experience? Did you try to apply to scholarship? What's your opinion? Can I start doing research and hope for funds.</p>

<p>In Canada there are few places without fee, therefore it should be very competitive, but at least there is a chance. Usually they ask for GRE in mathematics and computer science; sometimes for IELTS. What's your opinion? I assume you should be really perfect in your field in order to get applied. </p>

<p>In China, very interesting option, without fee or with minimal fee plus one year to get a new language. It looks very attractive, especially with approach of Chinese government to education, as I know there are many programs for free. The only problem is to get the minimal communication in Chinese which may take up to a year according to experience of others. </p>

<p><strong>Addendum</strong>:</p>

<p>According to responses I decided to update my post.</p>

<p>I earned my bachelor degree 3 years ago, I have a good job, and I work as a programmer. Throughout the last year I am taking courses of master degree in my domestic university. I have one day off in week for studies. Three years is a long break but I feel the power is back. In my place it's not common that employer will pay for studies, of course I have some savings but this is not going to cover fee, and all spendings for at least two years. </p>

<p>I would like to go to research master. Right now I am not ready to get good grade at GRE, but I am working on it. I am not fluent in English, but in my opinion more important to be good in my field of study. </p>

The article's title, as well as the name of the software it describes, includes a subtle reference to <a href=""http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/all-your-base-are-belong-to-us"">this popular internet meme</a>. This gave me a good laugh, and an excuse to watch that ridiculously silly video again.</p>

<p>But on a more serious note, this is not the first time I have seen the use of subtle (or not-so-subtle) humor in the title of a scientific journal article, conference abstract, or poster presentation. Sometimes the humor is even injected into the body of the publication itself. But in general, we as scientists are expected to write in such a way that our findings are easily communicated and easily reproducible. The focus is on clarity, objectivity, and reproducibility.</p>

<p>There are of course no formal rules about the use of humor in scientific literature, but are there any <em>de facto</em> rules? Do these <em>de facto</em> rules depend on the field (computer science vs genetics) or the publisher (Oxford Univ. Press vs BioMed Central) or the journal's impact factor (Nature vs Frontiers in Genetics)? Does humor even have a place in scientific literature, or would we be better off without it?</p>

I can formulate a rough hierarchy between major concerns (things that need to be changed or this shouldn't be published) and relatively minor concerns (things I think would improve the manuscript, but aren't substantive enough to affect whether the paper is publishable or not).The question here concerns the latter, in essence I don't know where the cut-off in reasonableness should be for minor concerns.</p>

I'm not sure how to go about this though.</p>

<p>The main problem with me is that I have such a frustratingly common name that <em>a lot</em> of people cannot find me when they google me. So many of them simply don't notice the middle initial that I always use in between my first and last names, and this could actually become a major issue in academia, since people have little time and are prone to giving up quickly if they want to look for me (or for my papers) and can't find me at all (I know this having seen how several academics use the Internet and how they look for people's names). This, in turn, could easily ruin my citation count in the future (it's not just that - it's helpful to others when I have a less common name so that they can more easily locate my stuff). I already know at least several people who specifically told me that they tried to find my email but that they couldn't find it (and this isn't limited to just them - there are many, many more - including long-lost friends who have wanted to talk to me for a long time, but who couldn't find me due to said ultra-common name). Of course, people can go through the respective university directories, but how many people really do that? From my observations (when I've seen people look for someone else), very very few do it. Hell, there are even several people at my OWN university who share the same exact first+last name as me.</p>

<p>In Academia, this is even a bigger problem because the vast majority of your connections will be people who only vaguely recognize/know you, so they may know most of the search clues. Even a ""full name"" + university won't solve all the problems, because I may switch universities and people may only remember the old university that I was in. I'm also very very interdisciplinary, so I want to be searchable to people outside my field as well.</p>

<p>And even if I fix the issue for Google with a massive SEO operation or whatever (that may even be impossible for my ridiculously common name), it's still not going to fix the problem for all of the other ways that people use search.</p>

<p>I'm currently transitioning between undergrad and grad school, so now may be the perfect time for a name change? But I don't know what to do. Is it better for me to change my first name or my last name? The problem is that a citation like ""Chen 2011"" is going to produce so many entries that <em>no one</em> will ever find them, even though they frequently do google things like that (and I simply cannot prevent people from googling something like that). Chen is so frustratingly common that even a ""Chen and Name2 2011"" paper could come from some random medical paper rather than from something I wrote.</p>

<p>As an additional complication, the % of Chinese people using the English Internet is exponentially rising, and I can only expect the problem to get worse in the future because of that (and not just for my first name, but even variants of my first name too).</p>

I believe how one reads a book differs significantly from how one reads a paper.
(This could be a question as well but IMO, the length, intention and structure are sufficient to cause the difference)</p>

<li><p>Should a book be read from start to finish word by word or through iterations (Skim, Analyse, Summarize)? </p></li>
<li><p>If I am interested in a particular chapter with a lot of dependencies, is it in my interest to read everything till that chapter or read that chapter > google unknown terms > read chapter again and loop? </p></li>
<li><p>If one gets stuck for over a certain threshold at something is it wise to continue assuming it as true or to persevere till the end and figure it out. <strong>This is true for research papers, is it true for books?</strong></p></li>

<p>However, my question does not concern the reviews I receive for the papers I submit, but concerns the reviews I write for papers I have been assigned. Since the whole process is done under confidentiality, it is not clear who owns the copyright on a review I wrote, and what does the review include. </p>

<p>For instance, let us assume that X is member of a PC of a conference Y, and assigns to me a review of a paper Z, written by A and B (assuming it's not a double-blind). Can I publish on my blog: ""Here is my review for Y, asked by X, on the paper Z, written by A and B""? </p>

<p>I think that there are two points here: </p>

<ol>
<li>Is it legal? (for instance, publishing the camera-ready version of a paper might be illegal due to the copyright transfer, would it be also the care here?). </li>
<li>Is it ethical? (who should I ask in order to do so? X? Y? A and B? everybody?). </li>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> There is been several comments/answer wondering <strong>why</strong> I would like to publish a review I wrote. To give a bit of background of this question, I believe that the current reviewing system, created when the academic community was small and there was no Internet (i.e. no easy access to information), might not be the best, although clearly working. This is for me a very interesting debate, but somehow out of the scope the Q&amp;A format of Academia SE, which is why I tried to focus on my question on whether it was possible to do so, not if it was the best thing to do in the current system (and just to be clear, I don't plan to do it, but I just like to know what are my options). Anyway, thanks for the answers bringing a different light on this debate. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> After seeing the update in Jeff's answer, I just realised that I didn't make it explicit that I was talking about reviews <em>after</em> the reviewing process. Jeff says that it's ok if the paper is accepted, and although I clearly understand the argument of <em>why</em> I shouldn't publish a review of a rejected paper, the question still holds: by publishing a review of a rejected paper, I publish the information that these authors submitted this paper to this conf/journal, which is supposed to be confidential between the authors and the editors.

661,"<p><sup>This question was written by a friend of mine. I'm helping them by posting it here, with permission.</sup></p>

<p>How should I use the name-year referencing system (loosely speaking, the Harvard system) in such cases where there are multiple works that have the same first author but a different set of coauthors?</p>

<p>In such cases where the maximum number of authors among all articles sharing the same first author is not more than three, or perhaps four, the solution is very simple. Just mention them all inline and use the reference list as usual. E.g. the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""... the complex formation was observed by Miller and Nelson (1991)""<br>
  ""... cf. Miller, Nelson and Byrne (1993)""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, if there are more authors in any of the articles, this gets quite tricky, since listing a huge number of authors inline is definitely not an option to me. I'd rather change to number references.</p>

<p>Now, making the references unambiguous is not a problem. For instance, the following references could be addressed to inline as ""Barton et al."" without in any way losing the one-to-one relation between inline citations and reference list entries. That is, the articles are differentiated, as the other is ""Barton et al. (1980)"" and the other ""Barton et al. (1985)"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Barton, D. H. R.; Crich, D.; Potier, P. (1985). ""On the mechanism of the decarboxylative rearrangement of thiohydroxamic esters"". Tetrahedron Lett. 26, 5943.</p>
  
  <p>Barton, D. H. R.; Dowlatshahi, H. A.; Motherwell, W. B.; Villemin, D. V. (1980). ""A New Radical Decarboxylation Reaction for the Conversion of Carboxylic Acids into Hydrocarbons"". J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun., p. 732.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What really <em>is</em> the problem is the alphabetical order in which the references should be sorted in the reference list. If the articles listed above are referred to just as ""Barton et al."", the reader does not know the exact position in the reference list where to find the articles.</p>

<p>One solution might be just ignoring this slight complication.</p>

<p>Other solution is to use ""et al"" in the reference list, too, if absolutely necessary. Thus, in the example above, the first article would be referred to as ""Barton, Crich and Potier (1985)"" inline, and the latter as ""Barton et al. (1980)"".</p>

<p>In the reference list, they would be expressed <em>and arranged</em> according to the inline cites:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Barton, D. H. R.; Crich, D.; Potier, P. (1985). ""On the mechanism of the decarboxylative rearrangement of thiohydroxamic esters"". Tetrahedron Lett. 26, 5943.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Please don't suggest Google, since I did not find an answer after 30 minutes of search. There are perhaps hundreds of ""Harvard citation guides"" available, but I found none that addressed this problem.</p>

670,"<p>I am an M.Sc. student in mathematics. I was recently invited by some Ph.D. students and Post-Docs (a group of 5 people, including myself) to join their study group. We are reading a specific text, which should get us ready to read some more advanced work. This work is relevant to the research of some of the other people in the group, but my main goal is to experience this learning methodology with the added advantage of getting to know a few aesthetic results in mathematics.</p>

<p>We met around 6 times, and it is not what I'm used to from courses in the sense that we don't completely understand all the details. Nevertheless, we go on reading.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We encounter a definition and we can't find out its exact meaning. In this case we usually know of an example of a mathematical object satisfying this definition (because it's mentioned in the text) and we just try to see how the propositions in the text apply to the specific example.</p></li>
<li><p>A proof is given with very few details - we manage to fill in some of the gaps, but not all of them, so we just take an example again and simply accept the statement of the theorem so we can use it later.</p></li>
<li><p>An excercise is given in the text and we only solve part of it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We allow ourselves to skip some details because this text is only meant to get us ready for some more advanced, but more specific, material. My question is how we can find out whether or not we are gaining anything, and how we can gain more given the fact that we are all busy and don't want to invest much more time in this specific reading (we have a 3 hours meeting every week).</p>

<p>I have a feeling that I'm ""getting used"" to some ideas and facts while reading this text (in contrast with ""completely understanding""), but I'm not sure if I'm really gaining anything or whether it's just an illusion and I'm not sure how to test my gain of knowledge. The exercises in the text allow us to test our understanding of the details, but not of the general ideas.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I will clarify what the question is, in response to aeismail's comment:</p>

<p>As Charles and Nunoxic say, the question of whether shallow-reading is useful is separate from the fact that we are studying in a group. So, the 2 separate questions are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>When reading without understanding all the details, how can I find out whether or not I'm gaining anything?</p></li>
  <li><p>How can we make the process of studying in a group for 3 hours a week most efficient?</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>These 2 may have better been asked as 2 separate questions, but I did not  notice that (in my mind they were related because the group study was the first time I encountered shallow-reading).
To summarize the answers I got so far:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>It <strong>is</strong> possible, for some people, to gain knowledge from shallow-reading and one way to test it is to see if you understand <strong>why</strong> each topic is being developed and <strong>why</strong> the text is structured the way it is.</p></li>
  <li><p>When studying in a group, one should test his ability to work out the details himself after the group sessions.</p></li>

694,"<p>Unfortunately, I did not know where to post this sort of question as it is very ambiguous. So I figured the Academia forum was the best place to ask, but feel free to point me to another direction. That said, this question is more about getting inspiration, rather than getting answers.</p>

<p>Here's my story: I'm currently studying computer science at college, and finally being top of my class in a particular course has given me the confidence to strive for greater things than I originally thought possible for myself. I want to pursue a job in research, because I would rather help mankind with technological/innovative progress than financial/social progress... So my dream is to acquire myself a well-earned Ph.D.</p>

<p>But here's the thing: I've studied computer security most of my life (leisure-study), and always imagined that this would be my main field of research because I'm very good at this specific area of expertise.</p>

<p>However, recently i've started to rethink this career path. My realization was that this field, albeit obviously not wasteful, was not going to prove beneficial for mankind in general/long-term. Unless we could use these defensive information technologies against a synthetic alien invasion, who's <em>plan A</em> was to destroy our Internet, hindering communications. But somehow I still think they would succeed.</p>

<p>So I have started to look into other areas of computer science. I kinda always had a dream of working with quantum computers (probably more a physics/engineering field at the moment), but i'm not really one of those extremely hardcore nerd types (God bless you guys.), so I suppose that's out of reach for me.</p>

<p>I'm leaning towards artificial intelligence, because I imagine that the two most prominent areas of research that will cause significiant improvements on our way of life will be either quantum computers, for their theoretical astonomical computational powers, and self-aware ""strong AIs"" that can help our race with all our physical, philosophical and economical problems (to name a few).</p>

<p>But I would still like to know if you guys think I should try to pursue something different. I'm not all that great at mathematics, but i'm extremely committed to my work once I begin, so I wouldn't mind becoming one of those ""hardcore nerd types"". I looked abit on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science</a> , and skimmed the theoretical computer science section, but nothing really sticks.</p>

<p>P.S. Please do not provide an answer such as ""just learn what you love to learn"", but it's not that simple in this case. I love just about everything that has to do with computers, both theory and applied, and computer science isn't a small genre to pick from.</p>

768,"<p>Background: I have the opportunity to pursue a Computer Science graduate degree at a well respected program (around top 20). I spoke with the professors at the university and I feel like I am a good fit with their research program. My ultimate pursuits are to complete a PhD in CS. I've done research as an undergraduate and it has only confirmed my notion that I want to pursue a research track career.</p>

<p>More background: I applied to jobs (in case I was rejected to all the programs I applied for) prior to hearing back from my respective graduate programs. I accepted a position for an industry job (this was to secure I wouldn't be both unemployed &amp; not in school).</p>

<p>Dilemma: Turns out my top graduate school is very interested in me, and I'm very interested in them. I would rather go to graduate school than work in industry forever. The industry job pays very well. I am split between A) working for a maximum of 1 year(It would only be 1 year, seriously I do not care about the money enough to work past a year) and B) going straight to graduate school. </p>

<p>My concerns are as follows, if I choose A): </p>

<ul>
<li>Could I potentially defer my admissions?</li>
<li>If I am not allowed to defer my admissions, would I have a good chance of re-applying and being accepted a year later?</li>
<li>Would my potential advisers look <em>down</em> on me for deciding to work a year?</li>
</ul>

<p>I already made my mind up it would be a 1 year gig if I decide A). I know some people say once you make money, you may not be able to readjust to the graduate salary pay. But I don't think that will apply to because I'm going to live very frugally with or without industry pay.</p>

778,"<p>I am most of the way through my freshman year at Washington State University, pursuing a BS in  Computer Science. Going away to school has been rough, and I have been pretty depressed for most of the time there. Right now, I am leaning towards not wanting to continue my education, but my parents are strongly opposed.</p>

<h2>Why I don't think I need college</h2>

<p>One of the main factors that is pushing me away from school is the fact that I already spend plenty of time working on my own software projects. On my own, I have gained extensive knowledge and experience with web application development, using platforms that are far too new to have a undergraduate class that teaches them. These are platforms used in real workplaces and production software, and I would not gain these skills in school.</p>

<p>Second, I have lost a lot of faith in my school after seeing so much incompetency from people who are meant to be educating me. The professors outsource a majority of their work to their TA's, who I feel I know more than. My Computer Science class is really just an entourage of TA's parroting the words of the professor, with embarrassingly little of their own understanding.</p>

<p>Another big reason is that for 10 weeks this summer, I will be travelling to Silicon Valley to take part in a 'startup accelerator program'. This is a program where already-established tech entrepreneurs and investors help people who are new to the game with building their product and starting their company. At the end of the 10 weeks, investors decide how much they want to put into each company, in exchange for some equity. Of the companies that go through these kinds of programs, a very high amount succeed. I feel that if the developers I am working with and I do well here (no, it is not guaranteed that we will make money), college is pointless for me.</p>

<h2>What college is like for me now</h2>

<p>College has been hard for me. Not because I am not capable of understanding the material, and not because I don't have enough time to get all my work done. I have been suffering in my classes because instead of going to class or finishing assignments, I work on my own projects.</p>

<p>Of course, if I forced myself to put time and effort into this work, I would achieve satisfactorily. However, that is much easier said than done.</p>

<p>In order to start caring about school, I would need to drop all my other software side-projects (or at least greatly limit the time I spend on them). Essentially, this is a choice, and right now I will always pick my own projects over school.</p>

<h2>Do I really need school?</h2>

<p>After all that I have seen about the limited job market (even for degree-holders) and all that I have experienced in school, I am really questioning whether I need to stay in school. Convince me whether or not I really need a BS, or any other advice you can give about the subject.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read and answer this. I normally feel bad taking time away from other people for my own benefit, but this is a major life-decision, and I cannot properly come to consensus on my own.</p>

I enjoy Pure Mathematics and Theoretical Physics and would not want to do anything else with my life just because I could not do anything else since I find them too damn interesting. What I do not enjoy is the grade-driven-here-is-the-next-thing-for-the-exam learning that doesn't give anyone the big picture. I have been working non-stop to make sure I perform in my courses, undergraduate research, etc. and I am just wondering if there is any way to learn about these topics at a slower pace or just have more time to think about the topics eventually. I understand I will have to at least get through graduate school and get a PhD (otherwise there would be a chance I'd turn out as a crackpot), but I'm just really tired of having so much information crammed into me without having the time to think about what I am learning. I want to do my own additional research on topics I see connections between, and think more about the big picture of how the different fields of Pure Mathematics and Theoretical Physics are related. There are so many unfinished papers that I have started throughout my undergraduate on embeddings of low-dimensional manifolds, determining knot invariants by unique methods, etc. but I just have no time to think about what I want to think about when there's that Real Analysis assignment due the day after my midterm in E&amp;M which I had to stay up all night studying for because I had three quizzes the previous week in blah blah blah blah... for years on end.</p>

I have worked in various jobs as a research assistant (physics, biology, economics) usually involving programming, mathematics or statistics.  As a newly minted undergraduate, I didn't really have much confidence in myself and I completely ruled out graduate school as pointless.  I didn't think of myself as smart enough.  I drifted into working in labs, because those are some of the easiest ones for which one can get a work permit in the US as a non-American.</p>

<p>Having worked in academia for a while now, I've had a chance to leap into various fields and help build solutions to complex problems.

(If you looked at US News rankings or the Academic Ranking of World Universities, it's in the top 5.)</p>

<p>Lately, I've been thinking about applying for graduate school.  I do have a few papers in various fields.  I'm thinking of a PhD in either pure mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics or computer science. </p>

<ul>
<li>to gain experience</li>
<li>to bolster my CV</li>
<li>to learn to be a better teacher</li>
</ul>

<p>That last point is particularly important to me, because I feel I have received insufficient training in how to teach mathematics well.</p>

<p>Now, I have done the usual TA thing.  For the past year, I have also been an adjunct instructor at a local four-year college, so I pretty much know what it's like to be ""fully responsible"" for a course.  What I am looking for are challenging opportunities which allow me to do some–or all–of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>teach fairly sophisticated math to bright high school students / undergraduates</li>
<li>engage them in innovative thinking/research</li>
<li>be consistently mentored/evaluated throughout the duration of this experience</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, the last point is rather important to me.  So my question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do such programs exist?</p>

<p>I am sure they do, but when Googling, I invariably come up with graduate summer schools, or ""local"" opportunities. (By ""local"" here, I mean those which are only eligible to students in that particular school's graduate program.) So I am hoping someone (or several people) here know more about it than Google does.</p>

<p>I know that most opportunities for this summer have probably already expired, but I want to stress I am not only focused on summer sessions.  In particular, I would gladly forego my usual TA appointment for a semester, to be a part of a more difficult and rewarding experience somewhere else.</p>

  <li>Are there universites offering a B.Sc. in computer science aimed solely at giving the best training to future theoretical computer science researchers?<br>
  (in the universities I checked, the programs are a combination of training people for research and training people to be programmers in the industry).</li>
  <li>As it seems not to be the case in most universities, is there a reason not to offer such programs? (financial maybe)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The motivation for the questions:</p>

<p>I am a mathematics M.Sc. student.
I had several conversations with researchers (full/associate professors) in theoretical computer science when I was looking for a thesis advisor. Three of them mentioned to me that they wish they would have learnt more mathematics in their basic training (two of them had a B.Sc. in mathematics and computer science and said they wished they did an M.Sc. in mathematics as well and one of them studied computer science only for a B.Sc.).
Their comments referred to funtional analysis (by a researcher in metric embeddings), to group theoretic constructions of expander graphs, etc.</p>

<p>This led me to check the program in computer science and here is what I found:</p>

<p>If a student really tries to get as much cs-theory and mathmematics in his B.Sc, he can study: 38% theoretical computer science, 40% mathematics with mathematics students, 6% mathematics with cs-students only, 16% technical courses. This amounts to 16% waste of time (for a future theoertical cs researchers) and 6% non-optimal use of time (as these math courses with cs-students feel a bit like high-school math).</p>

<p>I included the basic programming courses under theoretical cs because I believe they are essential in order to ""know what you're talking about"" when studying algorithms, computability, etc.
The situation is even a little worse from the perspective of this student because I included all the graduate courses in theoretical cs offered to undergrads, so he will have less theoretical cs courses to take during the M.Sc.</p>

<p>It seems like a much better choice for a future cs theory researcher is to study mathematics and take the cs theory courses (together with the most basic programming courses) as the ""free choice"" courses. I feel lucky to have done that as it seems that I would not have received such an excellent training if I had gone for the university's fixed cs+math program.</p>

<p>I think that the cs world could benefit alot if universities offered both B.Sc. and M.Sc. programs in ""mathematics and theoretical computer science"". This can be good both in giving a better training and in encouraging future colloboration.</p>

<p>So here's another question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you agree that such programs (""mathematics and theoretical computer science"") are a better alternative to cs-only programs or math+cs program which include many technical courses, as far as future theoretical cs researchers are concerned?</p>

1004,"<p>I would be interested in creating with some colleagues a <a href=""http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/fet-open/ye_en.html"">FET Young Explorers</a> project, in which I would be Work Package leader. 
I've been involved in several european projects, but always as a postdoc recruited by a PI (or WP leader), and I don't have a permanent position yet. So basically, the idea of applying to this project would be to get my full salary paid by the EU project, but I don't know if it's possible. </p>

<p>Indeed, in the FAQ, they say that the applicants need to have a position somewhere. I don't think getting a position would be a problem, but only if I come with my own salary. The question in this case is whether the hosting institution still needs to pay some part of my salary? </p>

<p>EDIT: A precision on the question. From the <a href=""ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/fp7/docs/calls/cooperation/ict/c-gfastrep-201103_en.pdf"">Guide for Applicants</a>, Section A3/Budget, p. 47, the part about the requested European Commission contribution:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The requested EC contribution shall be determined by applying the upper funding limits indicated below, per activity and per participant to the costs accepted by the Commission, or to the flat rates or lump sums.
  Maximum reimbursement rates of eligible costs</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Research and technological development = 50% or 75%*</li>
  <li>Demonstration activities = 50%</li>
  <li>Other activities (including management) = 100%</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>(*) For participants that are non profit public bodies, secondary and higher education establishments, research organisations and SMEs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if the salary of a researcher is included in the Research and Technological development, then does that mean that it's possible to only ask for 75% of it to the EC? (assuming the researcher is employed by a university). </p>

1006,"<p>Most universities (at least in North America) have the concept of ""Qualification Exams"" taken one year after the student joins the graduate course. These usually encompass all that was done in the first year and as undergraduate and might also test some other (research abilities) of the student by asking him to present papers (s)he found interesting.</p>

<p>Some universities treat this as a formality and everyone who attempts usually gets through while some universities take quals very seriously and won't allow the student to continue if he fails the quals (maybe, they will allow for 2nd attempt). These universities might subscribe reading lists consisting of textbooks and papers which comprises of ""must-have"" knowledge of the field. The latter might constitute as a difficult phase for students who find themselves ill prepared in a certain portion of the exam. (For instance, a pure math undergrad moving to a PhD in Fluid Mechanics and asked to attempt an exam on Fluid Machines)</p>

<p>Assuming STEM graduate course in a university which takes quals seriously (with a structure of written test >   oral exam > interview/research proposal presentation), </p>

Specifically,</p>

<ul>
<li>How is it any different from the undergraduate exams that students give? </li>
<li>Do you really ""prepare"" for these exams or should you bank on the courses you have taken and the homework you solved to get you through?</li>
<li>Repeatedly, I have been told by students (across departments and across institutes) that the faculty is only interested in the oral section of quals as a sanity check and to see whether you have the urge for learning something new; is this universally true? </li>

As a result, my skill-set is a classic case of a jack of all trades - master of none. The worst part is - everybody knows that a PhD is about getting deep into <strong>one</strong> specific topic. It's not about breadth - it's about depth. Even if I were to choose one of the PhD programs (and I <strong>must</strong> choose one), I have a feeling that I might get bored quickly and be prone to constant topic-changing / transferring. Again, this is not about being fickle - it's about following my heart, and my heart takes me to different things at different times.</p>

<p>Do you think I'm likely to fail / never complete my PhD? Does anyone have any advice about dealing with diverse interests? Has anyone felt the same way and dealt with it? I'd love to hear from you.</p>

<p>If a student stays a long time during his/her undergrad in a (world-class) research group, he/she is likely to have the opportunity to publish a bunch of papers (some of these might be good, well-referenced, etc; some of these might be not as good), and meet some good researchers around the world, and so on; it really required dedication. </p>

<p>On the other hand, take part into a training class for competitions (that requires dedication, as well) may lead students to gains in terms of working in group, time-boxed activities, etc, as well as to face the opportunity of proposing solutions for real-world problems, and so on. </p>

<p>It is really tough to do both, in order to have great results, since in both cases time and dedication is mandatory. Indeed, there are some ""outliers"" students that can do both in a very good way, but I'm trying to generalize my assumption, by considering ""average"" students. </p>

1206,"<h3>General background</h3>

<p>Some time ago, I was reading <a href=""http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/06/23/write-only-articles/"">a blog post, where there was some discussion about how many people read journal articles</a>.
I think that such an estimate is important when trying to assess the impact of research on society.
However, whereas internet sites readily track usage. Such information seems a little more difficult to come by when it comes to readership for a particular journal article.</p>

<h3>Initial Ideas</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Articles vary</strong>: Obviously journal articles vary in many ways and just as with citation counts, readership is likely to be highly skewed, perhaps something like a power function. In addition to academic impact, presumably articles that are available for free on the internet are read more.</li>
<li><strong>Time since publication</strong>: The number of reads increases over time, but the rate of readership presumably varies over time (perhaps a spike on initial release, and then gradual decline as relevance dissipates).</li>
<li><strong>Definitions of reading vary</strong>: Read counts would also increase or decrease based on how reading is defined. At the low end is a glance at an abstract. At the high end is carefully reading the entire article. I'd be happy with a working definition that involved reading at least two pages.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Initial Data</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.plosone.org/static/journalStatistics.action#PLoSONE"">PlosOne article statistics</a>: As a very rough guide, it suggests that mean views per article is around 800 per year.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.journalofvision.org/content/9/4/i?related-urls=yes&amp;legid=jov;9/4/i"">Journal of Vision</a>: this article reports some download statistics: ""In the most recent accounting in July, 2008, the top five articles were each downloaded between 1,993 and 3,478 times.""</li>
<li>Some journals list subscription counts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Initial Guess</h3>

<p>I find it useful to have a ball park estimate of these things.
My own initial guess, based on minimal data, is that readership is between 50 and 1000 times the citation count for the article. Linking the estimate to citation count makes it easier to estimate for a given article and should incorporate effects like time and journal prestige.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<ul>
<li>What is a good estimate of how many people read a given journal article?</li>
<li>What data and sources of information justify this estimate?</li>
<li>Is there any established literature that can inform such an estimate?</li>

1208,"<p>I have recently applied to two PhD programs (in Europe) under professors working in the area of Sound and Music Computing (SMC). Both programs are very well regarded in this area.</p>

<li>Music information retrieval</li>
<li>Computational musicology</li>
<li>Algorithmic composition / performance</li>
<li>Sentiment and expression modelling in music</li>
<li>Computational approaches to music cognition</li>
<li>Audio signal processing</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a complete list. I find the field very interesting.</p>

<p>However, would the industry want to hire someone with a PhD in SMC? Let's say Google (just as an example), which is known to hire many PhDs. Would they be interested in someone with a PhD in SMC, or would they restrict themselves to machine learning / web / search PhDs? And yes... I'm sure that Yamaha would love to hire an SMC PhD, but would I be restricting my options to only a small subset of the industry?</p>

<p>What about academia? How would they look upon an applicant to the assistant professor position who has a PhD in this area? Would they simply reject him saying ""Sorry, but we don't do research in your area..."", since it is true that <strong>most</strong> CS departments don't do active research in SMC? Again, would I be restricting my options to only a small subset of universities?</p>

<p>Secondly, how easy / hard is it to switch fields AFTER doing a PhD in it? I may like SMC enough to work on it for 5 years (and get a PhD) but I MAY not want to work on it for a lifetime. In industry or academia, could I switch to something else when (and if) I want to?</p>

<p>One researcher told me that I should only consider pursuing my interest in SMC <strong>after</strong> I have already established myself in some other, more fundamental, area of CS, like algorithms or AI. Do you agree?</p>

1228,"<p>I am an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at the University of Florida. In response to recent budget cuts to higher education in Florida, my department (Computer and Information Sciences and Engineering, CISE) could be undergoing some restructuring, namely the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>All of the Computer Engineering Degree programs, BS, MS and PhD, would be moved from the Computer &amp; Information Science and Engineering Dept. to the Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept. along with most of the advising staff.</li>
<li>Roughly half of the faculty would be offered the opportunity to move to Electrical/Computer Eng. (ECE), Biomedical Eng. (BME), or Industrial/Systems Eng. (ISE).</li>
<li>Staff positions in CISE which are currently supporting research and graduate programs would be eliminated.</li>
<li>The activities currently covered by TAs would be reassigned to faculty and the TA budget for CISE would be eliminated.</li>
<li>Any faculty member who wishes to stay in CISE may do so, but with a revised assignment focused on teaching and advising.</li>
</ul>

<p>(<a href=""http://saveufcise.wordpress.com/"">click here for additional information</a>)</p>

<p>The Dean of our college claims that eliminating research and TA support within the CISE department will have no effect on the quality of the education future students will receive. She also claims that existing research in the department will be unaffected, except that it will be moved to ECE, BME, or ISE.</p>

<p>As an undergrad, I don't feel qualified to challenge these claims. Therefore, I would like to hear your opinions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Will the quality of education in the CISE department be the same after this restructuring?</li>
<li>Can software-oriented research take place in a department which, until now, has concentrated solely on hardware/electronics?</li>
<li>Since only half of the faculty will be moved to a research department, half must remain in CISE and focus solely on teaching (with no TA support). Do you think these professors will remain at UF given the circumstances?</li>
<li>Will the teaching-only CISE department be able to attract quality professors? Top students?</li>
<li>Will employers value a UF CISE degree as much as they do now? [thanks for pointing this one out JeffE]</li>
</ul>

<p>Faculty and graduate students in the department know exactly how these changes will affect them (and they aren't pleased!), however many of the undergrads are a bit uncertain. I (and the rest of us undergrads) would really appreciate any wisdom to help clear things up. Thanks in advance!</p>

1270,"<p>In EE/EC/CS departments, there are certain fields that are theory-based (like the algo or complexity groups), ones that lean towards systems implementation (OS, programming languages, etc) and others have a component of both (like networking). </p>

<p>In such a field like networking, there are professors who work on hard-core math modelling (<a href=""http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~srikant/"" rel=""nofollow"">example</a>) and people who work on implementation and protocol design (<a href=""http://nms.csail.mit.edu/~hari/"" rel=""nofollow"">example</a>). From what I glean from my own paper-reading experience, the natures of these papers are as different as chalk and cheese: the math papers seem to look for ways to cast the problem in a mathematical framework and try to derive their results from such a set-up, while the implementation-oriented papers conceive of some algorithm and a protocol (based solely on logical argument rather than any rigorous mathematical premise) and present the results of their software simulations.</p>

<p>While on paper people argue there is no divide between theory and practice, at least to me the approach towards research differs widely between faculty members in the same field and department. Now to my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>How important is math emphasis in an applied field like networking? Industry work is almost always simulation-based from whatever I have seen. After all, networks are there to be implemented and deployed, so why bother about probabilistic modelling? </li>
<li>When there are two modes of research in a particular field, will the PhD student's approach play a role in faculty recruitment?</li>
<li>Is there a widespread notion of one being superior to another? I know of professors and students who widely emphasise math and pooh-pooh ""S-BAA: simulation based on arbitrary algorithm"" type of papers. </li>

<li>Outlining, writing long documents (currently Lyx)</li>
<li>Task, time and project management (currently misplaced and lost pieces of paper)</li>

<p>I can imagine that these steps apply to most academics, and many will share my interest in developing a more productive workflow. In my research on potential solutions to this issue, I keep being drawn by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Org-mode"">org-mode</a> as a potential swiss-knife solution that can take care of all these needs, and be my mainstay as a personal-information-manager, organiser and text editor. But being built on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs"">emacs</a>, I find it forbidding.

<p>The question especially applies to journals that operate with a rigorous profit motive. The subscription is very high, so wouldn't publishing in such journals affect the paper's citation count and deter the spread of knowledge about the work within academic circles?</p>

<p>Moreover, given the need to conserve paper, why should journals spend on printing research papers? Wouldn't an online version suffice, as most people use only local computer printouts anyway?

<hr>

<h3>Background:</h3>

<p>When hearing about development or history of science, the phrase 'widely accepted' is quite popular. One of the common stories seems to be of some discovery which nobody wanted to believe when published, but a decade or a few later the scientific world came to accept it and it turned into consensus. Prime examples in history would be the heliocentric world view or the theory of evolution.</p>

<p>More recently, I have read 'The Selfish Gene' by Richard Dawkins. He takes every chance to provide evidence that the theory of group selection is unnecessary to explain evolution. The book was published in 1976, when group selection was apparently quite popular. In annotations of the current edition, he gives comments about how the scientific world has now more accepted that group selection is wrong. I asked a question about one of his claims which I did not fully understand (irrelevant here) on Biology.SE and - unexpectedly - promptly got answers by people claiming that group selection was presently very widely accepted.</p>

1482,"<p><strong>Background</strong>
I am asking this question in the context of the long running plagiarism scandal in Germany.The most prominent victim of the scandal of plagiarized doctoral dissertations by politicians was former defense minister <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Theodor_zu_Guttenberg#Doctorate_plagiarism"">Guttenberg</a>. His doctoral title was withdrawn, and he resigned from his position. He was followed by several other politicians, and now even the German Education and Research Minister Annette Schavan is under <a href=""http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/05/german-research-minister-faces.html?ref=ra"">suspicion of plagiarism</a>.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is that for all these people, the plagiarism was detected only due to plagiarism detection wikis like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VroniPlag_Wiki"">VroniPlag</a> and GuttenPlag, where ordinary people compared these doctoral dissertations with other published work. The only role of universities has been to respond to allegations that are especially well documented and have caused a reasonable amount of public uproar.</p>

<p>Don't the Universities themselves bear any responsibility for letting this plagiarism go undetected? In fact Guttenberg's dissertation was awarded a <em>summa cum laude</em>. It appears as if their is no mechanism whatsoever (at least in German universities) to detect academic fraud.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any mechanism at all to detect plagiarism or fraudulent research in PhD dissertations (doctoral theses)?</strong></p>

<p>I understand that there are probably country based differences and my experience is primarily with the German system. Still it would be good to know the seriousness with which academic fraud is taken in different countries. This appears especially pertinent to the maintenance of the credibility of academia in general and doctoral degrees in particular, and yet there seem to be no checks whatsoever!</p>

1608,"<p>So I've just written up a report that could eventually turn into a publishable manuscript, but since I'm new and this would be the first paper that I've ever written, I'm definitely going to need quite a bit of feedback before submitting it (especially since it's important for research to be interesting to multiple individuals if it's ever going to be cited).</p>

<p>So I'm wondering - how should I phrase an email asking someone to look at my work? Which people should I ask to comment on my work? And how would it differ from professor to graduate student? I'm thinking that my research can be interesting and helpful to a few grad students, so they can often provide a lot of help (that, and they have a lot more time than professors).</p>

<p>If one has time, I'm also wondering if it's a good idea to send the manuscript to people sequentially (e.g. send it to a 2nd person only after getting feedback from the first). That way, no effort is lost if two people suggest the same set of changes.</p>

<p>When applying for the PhD program in mathematics, usually, one is not required to specify in what field (e.g., PDE, dynamical system, etc.) he/she intends to do. However, I don't know whether it will be <em>disadvantage</em> that one doesn't not have a specific field in mind at all. I ask this question because some people suggest the students who are applying to the graduate school should talk to or connect with the professor who is in the school he/she intend to apply for.

1628,"<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I like the idea of writing an academic book.</p>

<ul>
<li>It currently looks better on a CV when applying for jobs, grants, promotions, etc. than a blog post, or a website.</li>
<li>Libraries and people archive the work</li>
<li>Most of the best academic content currently seems to end up in books and journal articles, rather than on websites.</li>
<li>People have an attractive physical copy to engage with if they want.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I don't like the constraints imposed by a book. In particular, readership is limited to those who buy/borrow the book or have access to a library.</p>

<h3>Aim</h3>

<p>In some cases, I'd prefer to write something like an ""open access book"". </p>

<ul>
<li>If readers want the physical copy, they can purchase the book. Ideally some of this revenue would go to the author, but I'm not too fussed if the publisher just uses this money to fund promotion, editorial assistance, production, etc.</li>
<li>However, access to a PDF of the book is free online. </li>
<li>The book gets an ISBN, archiving, availability on Amazon, etc. and all the academic recognition associated with publishing an academic book.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>So, are there any options for doing this, and what might be best option?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Are there any case studies of others who have done this?</strong></li>

<p>Here's the question though: how many PhD students actually manage to make meaningful comments or suggestions about a professor's work?

And if the comments are implemented, does the professor ever notify the student?</p>

<p>I'm saying this as someone who makes <em>a lot</em> of suggestions/comments to other people, but who can never be sure whether or not they find them helpful. Most suggestions seem to be discarded simply because it takes too much time/effort to implement them.</p>

For example, even in the states I think everyone would say Oxford and Cambridge are well respected, but beyond that most (including myself) are not aware of other schools not in the U.S. </p></li>
<li><p>What is the timeframe for applying to these schools? In the U.S. most schools allow you to transfer into the spring or fall semesters, with the application being due approximately 6 months in advance (for example, due in March for fall semester that starts in September) and the application process starting 9 months in advance.  </p></li>

I could not find any other valuable online sources regarding Linguistics for the answers I seek. Let me start with my qualification. I am a female international student with a Masters in English Linguistics and Literature with a percentage of 65.9. Although its the best language university in my country but it is not that famous anywhere else. My grade average was B with no A or C in any of the individual modules. We dont have GPA system for language studies.</p>

<p>This percentage is regarded with high value in my country and I was one of the top four in my class. However, there is no set grading scale used by the examiners in my country and it is very rare, in fact, almost impossible to score above 70% in any language related field. And that is the case for the most perfect performance. </p>

<p>My Bachelors scores suck (59.9%). I was disappointed in myself for not being able to get admission into a medical school(marginally) like the rest of my siblings and ending up doing Bachelors in law and English Literature was a major shock for my planned future career ( I had been a brilliant student before). I, however, slowly developed interest in Linguistics and did well in Masters.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My first question is, as most good Universities require a GPA of 3 or above with successful candidates usually having more than 3.6, what are my chances of admission? How can I go about explaining my situation as the % of students pursuing Linguistics doctorate at US from my country is very low. Are my scores too horrible?</p></li>
<li><p>My only research was Masters thesis in a literature related field, titled, 'Autobiographical element in Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ""One Hundred Years of Solitude""' of almost 40,000 words. Will it hinder my chance for admission into Linguistics?  </p></li>
<li><p>What else can I do to improve my application and up my chances specifically for Lingsuitics? How should I lay out my SOP? My ultimate preference would be Berkeley,UCLA and MIT. Should I even think about these universities with such scores?  </p></li>

1930,"<p>My question is about using a Ph.D. title/grade from an EU University in Germany.
Germany recognizes (properly obtained) Ph.D.s from other EU countries.
People with an EU Ph.D. are allowed to use the abbreviation ""Dr."" in front of their names without mentioning the country of origin (which is AFAIK required for some other countries) or using the original version. However, reading <a href=""http://www.stmwfk.bayern.de/Hochschule/pdf/grade.pdf"">this information letter from the Bavarian State Ministry of Sciences, Research and the Arts</a>, section 1.3.2. (German), you are not allowed to use both together.</p>

<p>I'm confused about this and its exact scope. 
Does this mean a Ph.D. holder can't call him-/herself ""Dr. Firstname Lastname"" on a business card and then list ""Ph.D."" together with the other titles like ""M.Eng., Dipl.Ing."" on a second line? Using ""Firstname Lastname, Ph.D."" in Germany would not have the same effect then the first form. Not mentioning the Ph.D. at all however would keep many people wondering what kind of doctor grade you have. Maybe it only means not to use ""Dr. Firstname Lastname, Ph.D."", but the business card example is very close to that.<br>
Also, can ""Ph.D."" be used in one occasion and then ""Dr."" in a different one, or do you have to stick with one? Would it be ok to use ""Dr."" on your German business card and ""Ph.D."" on your English one? Even if both are on opposite sides of the same card?</p>

<p>When preparing a final version of a figure, it appears that some changes could be more easily made in a graphics software (gimp, inkscape, scribus, adobe) as opposed to R. Such changes might be done more efficiently, and more to the publishers standards, by the publisher. Apparently, the publisher uses some such software to makes final changes to the image anyway. Presumably, these changes can do it more efficiently and to their standards. Also, some tasks would be trivial or would be done anyway by the publisher.</p>

2063,"<p>I have a bad habit of trying to objectively measure myself and my understanding. One of the ways I do this is by saying to myself ""I only understand X after I have read the entire chapter in this book on X"" or ""I can start doing a problem on X after I have read all about X."" I do this because it generally guarantees that I haven't missed something important; that I'm not stuck on something that's obvious to everybody else. It's also something external that I can point to to justify my ignorance. Like, if I didn't know something, I could say ""Well if that's important, then why didn't this author mention it in this entire chapter?""</p>

<p>A lot of my peers don't do this. I think most of them pick up just enough from lecture to do the assignments. I'm really starting to wish I was like that because this way of learning is seriously failing. It's starting to take a tremendous amount of time and I'm under time constraints. But it bothers the hell out of me if I can't first get all the facts down.</p>

<p>And actually I did this last semester with one class because it was simply unfeasible to follow along with the book. When I look back I feel somewhat bad about it because the subject truly interested me.</p>

<ul>
<li>So how should I balance <strong>learning</strong> and <strong>solving assignments</strong> during coursework? On one hand, I spend a lot of time with the books as there's a lot of stuff to learn and it helps to know all the facts and the motivation behind the ideas, as they can be enlightening. On the other hand, it leaves no time and my performance in school could be better if I focused more time on doing the assignments.</li>

<p>The majority of my collaborations are with colleagues outside of my state.

Since it's my own project (and it's exploratory research), the two supervisors don't need to pressure me to get results. So - I got into a lot of dead ends in my current undergrad research project, and while I've definitely learned <em>a lot</em> in my current research, I highly doubt it can lead to a publication by now, especially since my supervisors are unfamiliar with the technical details of my model, and the objective of the research is such that there aren't many people in the nation I can contact who are familiar with what my supervisors want to do. I've already contacted a number of people who might be familiar with it, but most of my emails have gone without reply.</p>

<p>At this point, I only have a month left before I leave for graduate school, and I'm not sure how I should conclude my research with my supervisors.

<p>I am an assistant professor at a small comprehensive 4-year public institution. My department (chemistry) has implemented a new strategic plan. One of our principle action items involves recruiting more high school students to attend our institution with the intention in majoring in chemistry. </p>

<p>I know that research is conducted, probably at the institution level, on what recruitment strategies are successful in various disciplines. However, since my research background is in chemistry, I am not familiar with the resources to find this research.</p>

<p>I will start with this question: What journals and/or databases should I be reading and using? I know about the <em>Chronicle of Higher Eduction</em>. Which others are good resources?</p>

<p>Update: I would like to find relatively recent reports, preferably in peer-reviewed literature or published by not-for-profits. Strategies that use social media would be great. There is a nice study linked in Dan C.'s answer, but it is from April 2004, meaning the data likely predates Facebook.</p>

2219,"<p>I am a third year (starting fourth year in the fall) PhD student in mathematics. I've passed all qualifying exams and am currently doing research. As far as I can tell, I am not doing poorly. I have the good fortune of having a great advisor, being in a very supportive department, and having friends and family who genuinely care about my success. </p>

<p>The fact is research is hard. It appears to consist primarily of staring at a problem for days and days and days without getting anywhere. Sometimes, rarely, I do figure something out and that feels wonderful, but the overwhelming majority of my time appears to be spent banging my head against a mostly figurative wall. I am not complaining about the material being hard, and I am not averse to putting in hard work, but I get frequently discouraged when I realize the vast volumes of mathematics that I yet know nothing about (and probably never will). It's very hard to quantify progress - in particular, there are too few tangible returns after too many hours worked. I find myself thinking along the lines of ""Oh, if only someone actually smart were thinking about this problem they would have solved it in moments"" and so on. </p>

<p>I've talked about this to some number of people; here is some advice I have received:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a day off. Putting in hours upon hours of trying things doesn't magically lead to a solution, particularly if the brain is tired and just wants to sleep.</li>
<li>Have a hobby. Since math research doesn't exactly provide instant gratification, a hobby might provide some instead. </li>
<li>Talk to other graduate students. Realize that many graduate students go through this.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interested to know how other folks have dealt with being discouraged as a graduate student. Does it get better with time and experience? Is this a sign that research is not for me and that I should seriously consider a life outside academia?</p>

  <li>Are there texts/papers/other resources discussing this subject?</li>

<ol>
<li>Excercises which are graded regularly throught the semester</li>
<li>Exercises for self-learning with a solutions manual provided</li>
<li>Quizes during the semester</li>
<li>Strictly technical questions in quizes/exams</li>

2269,"<p>This is similar to a previously asked question, but deals specifically with addressing the problem on the CV. My adviser had a bit of a personal meltdown and left the department while I was finishing analysis of field data/writing up. His students were assigned the following year to a non-tenured professor.  This new professor was of little help to me my last year of writing up, sat on my dissertation with no comments for over 6 months and only produced comments after I went to the departmental chair. He did not think much of the type work I was doing and went so far as to say so during my defense. I will add here that I have a number of publications (>5) including single authored ones-which for my field is significant- as well as an excellent track record of funding and in presenting my research. I have a strong CV but have had no success thus far in securing a job. I once saw one of the letters he had written for me (it needed to be included in a single PDF so he had to send it to me) and it was terrible. It talked mostly about him and how he really did not know me well and with a few generic sounding ""he will no doubt exceed"" sentences that just sounded fake. Months later a colleague suggested that I find a different reference than my adviser (but was not clear as to why). </p>

<p>So, my question is this: since committees will no doubt look at my list of referees and wonder at my lack of an adviser-I have taken to including a short ""note"" in the ""reference contact information"" section explaining that 1) my original adviser left academia at the end of my time as a student and 2) that my new adviser was up for tenure the year I defended and very busy and was in a different field than mine, so instead ""below are three people who are in a better position to judge me on my research, teaching, writing skills"".</p>

<p>Is this providing too much information or is this instead ensuring that rather than questioning and then rejecting my application the committees will stop and think ""oh okay, I can see why the applicant did not include their adviser""?</p>

If the book is really thick, and the readers may have different knowledge levels and familiarity with the book, some readers may find it not easy to locate the borrowed result within the reference book. So why don't people specify the source of a citation  as detailed as possible in books? </p>

2370,"<p>I was recently reading some papers regarding bridging the gap between academia and industry, specifically in undergraduate computer science and software engineering programs. The papers I read were published between the late 1970s and the mid 2010s. I noticed a stark contrast in papers published in the 1990s as compared to the 1970s with regards to education, often in reference to mathematics and science.</p>

<p>A small passage from <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807660"">Essential Elements of Software Engineering Education</a>, published in 1976:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is clear from the above discussion that the education of a software
  engineer will involve the study of a variety of subjects combined with
  a considerable amount of practical experience which must be
  accumulated over a number of years. From a university standpoint, the
  subject matter not only cuts across a number of traditional
  disciplines and boundaries, but also covers topics that historically
  have not been part of academic curricula.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This passage follows a discussion of problems that arise from teaching software engineering, specifically the difficulties in mapping certain aspects of industry into the classroom. This discussion is a significant portion of the paper, and similar discussions are prevalent in other papers written around the same period of time. Generally, there's an understanding that a wide knowledge base is needed in the fields of computer science and software engineering, but the trend is to focus on maximizing the skills and knowledge needed in industry.</p>

<p>Throughout everything published in the mid-to-late 1970s, I get the idea that the people designing the computer science and software engineering curricula understand the industry. This includes technical and non-technical topics, but always serving the needs of the profession. It's well summarized in this statement, also from Essential Elements of Software Engineering Education:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A curriculum in software engineering must be multi-form and in fact be
  a collection of curricula to meet the diverse needs of existing
  professional groups.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fast-forward to the 1990s. A passage from the <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=107088"">The SEI undergraduate curriculum in software engineering</a> reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mathematics and science content of the curriculum should help
  achieve two fundamental objectives. First, it should prepare students
  to participate competently in an increasingly technological society.
  This includes the ability to understand science and technology issues
  well enough to make informed political decisions. Second, the science
  and mathematics content should provide the students with an
  appropriate foundation for subsequent software engineering courses.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>While the physical and life sciences are fundamental to traditional
  engineering disciplines, they provide virtually no basis for software
  engineering. The only significant exception is that electricity and
  magnetism, common topics in introductory physics courses, support the
  study of the computer itself, and software engineers need a basic
  understanding of the machine for which they are developing software.
  To achieve the first objective stated above, however, it is probably
  the case that basic knowledge of physics, chemistry, and biology are
  essential in almost any undergraduate curriculum. Chemistry and
  biology, in particular, are likely to be increasingly important in
  understanding society’s health care, environmental, and genetic
  engineering issues in the next century.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is really the first time that I saw society come up in a discussion about the content of a curriculum. There were mentions of law and legal topics being relevant for software engineers and computer scientists in previous papers, but always from a professional standpoint. In the above quoted passage, the first objective (and I'm assuming the most important in the eyes of the author) of mathematics and science education is not to prepare the students for future course work or their first job in industry or for future research, but for functioning fully in modern society.</p>

<p>Beyond that, the authors even identify that these topics have limited utility in many industrial settings for software engineers. However, they continue to encourage that basic knowledge should be part of the curriculum for society's benefit.</p>

<p><strong>My questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What happened in the late 1970s into the 1990s that caused a shift from focusing on the profession and entering the workforce (both industrial and academia/research) to the general needs of the society in computer science and software engineering education?</li>
<li>Was this phenomenon localized to computer science and software engineering education or was it a widespread event?</li>
<li>What were the triggering events?</li>

<p>For instance:</p>

<p>Some people I have talked with about this issue recommended me to get a PhD from a top 20 statistics program.

Also I had a traditional probability and statistics for engineers class.</p>

I plan to self study undergrad level topology from munkres, abstract algebra from artin, and some advanced linear algebra and functional analysis may be some measure theory based probability etc. I can attend a university for these classes but it would be extremely difficult for me to manage it just because money constraints which I have. I have to admit that I learn better when I self study and I usually try to attempt  most of the exercises in the books.</p>

2480,"<p>I am a senior math major (computer science minor) who is pretty worried about the next step in my academic career. First, let me state that I'm about as sure as I can be that I want to get a PhD in mathematics. Unfortunately, I didn't realize what the field entailed, or my passion for it, until I had made many really poor decisions - mostly in the form of bad attendance. For example, I basically just showed up for tests in calc 2, 3, linear algebra, and differential equations, and consequently, my field of potential letters of recommendation is quite small. To make things worse, I come from a party school - I need letters! </p>

<p>I've had one professor (abstract algebra) offer to write me a letter, and I've taken my advanced calc sequence under a professor who I think could write me a good recommendation (adv calc 2 was a graduate course; had [i think] the highest grade out of about 15 students). I'm also taking topology (graduate level) this semester, and am hoping to impress my way to a third letter.</p>

<p>My GPA is okay - cumulative about 3.61; math is all A's and one C in linear algebra. I've also been working through a few books (Spivak's ""Calculus"" and ""Calculus on Manifolds,"" and am about to start Birkhoff and Maclane's ""Survey of Modern Algebra."" Although I love the material, and enjoy learning it, the independent studying probably stems from some feeling of inadequacy due to my past immaturity.</p>

<p>I got a 169/170 Q, 165/170 V on the general GRE. Also, I think I can crack 80% on the subject test, but am not overly confident about this. One glaring hole is that I have done zero research, and have done nothing extracurricular - I literally have nothing ""extra"" going for me.</p>

<p>My concern is that I've seen the resumes of many people accepted to top universities (PhD track), and I just don't stack up. But if my goal is to become a professor one day, it seems that where I go to school is extremely important. So should I just hope that I can get accepted into a top 30-50 school, or would it be beneficial to consider improving my resume in a solid Masters program so that better schools become available? </p>

<p>And if a masters is a viable option, what caliber of school would I need to excel at in order to be a competitive applicant for a top 10 PhD program?</p>

<pre><code>Rule 4: Poster Acceptance Means Nothing

Do not take the acceptance of a poster as an endorsement of your work. Conferences 
need attendees to be financially viable. Many attendees who are there on
grants cannot justify attending a conference unless they present. There are a
small number of speaking slots compared with attendees. How to solve the dilemma?
Enter posters; this way everyone can present. In other words, your poster has not
been endorsed, just accepted. To get endorsement from your peers, do good science
and present it well on the poster.

However, I've encountered multiple people who have a PhD in space science or particle physics, and have later moved to atmospheric science or remote sensing — one of them even after already having tenure, starting an entirely new topic while remaining at the same institute. How common or uncommon is it to change to an unrelated field within natural science? How much chance would one have of a post-doc if the newly graduated PhD has no experience with the actual topic whatsoever? Is it expected that a Postdoc spends the first 3–6 months getting into the field, or that he/she can dive into the depth right away?

2653,"<p>What is the best strategy to determine common knowledge in an unfamiliar field? I have provided an example below, but I am not looking for an answer specific to that example.</p>

<p>We have <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/2192/on-citing-common-knowledge-statements"">an answered question</a> that addresses whether and how common knowledge should be cited. A more difficult problem is determining what is common knowledge in an unfamiliar field. In my answer to the question linked, I provide one strategy, examining introductory textbooks in that field. However, as was mentioned in the comments, not all fields have introductory texts.</p>

<p>As an example, I am working on an institutional grant proposal. The proposed activities have to do with increasing retention rates of freshmen students, particularly in the sciences. We are looking at targeting pedagogical reform in introductory classes and increasing engagement through more and better co-curricular experiences. </p>

<p>My background is in chemistry. I do not know what is common knowledge in the worlds of pedagogy and student engagement/retention. I have been reading books and articles on the subjects, and citation practices have been inconsistent. Some authors provide citations for everything, including broad generalizations and common sense, like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>There are many reasons why an undergraduate student may choose to leave college.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>And then others provide very few citations, including for statements that seem like they should have been based on a study:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>More than half of all students who withdraw from college are freshmen.</li>
  <li>Less than half of the students who declare science majors will graduate with a degree in a science field.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I realize that the former case may be from overzealous paranoia about plagiarism, and the latter case may be an example of poor scholarship, but this is difficult to assess as an outsider.</p>

<p>EDIT: For clarification, I am asking about determining when something requires a citation if I am writing in a field that I do not normally participate in. I know that I should always cite things that are new, obscure, or counter to prevailing thought. I wouldn't necessarily need to cite things that are ""well-established"" or ""agreed-upon"". After a certain point, if enough studies have reaffirmed the same result, or if the result has been so widely cited that it becomes well-known, it is pointless to cite it. It is currently silly to provide a citation for ""The structure of DNA is a double helix formed by two complimentary strands held together by hydrogen-bonding between the base pairs."" At one point, however, it was not silly, because this idea was new. </p>

<p>How can I quickly determine where a finding is on the continuum between new/obscure and well established?</p>

2752,"<p>In general, building on unpublished work of another author, which he may have told you in  confidence, or you may encountered as a reviewer or by word of mouth or other informal means, is not an acceptable practice. Does the same apply if the author has uploaded his work on arXiv?</p>

<p>Here's a specific scenario: Suppose I submit a paper for review to a journal. The paper has results that could possibly be extended, however, the idea for extension is either not obvious or is not compatible with the theme of the paper, so I may plan to keep it for a  later paper. If I put the paper on arXiv would it be considered ok if someone else extends my results? This would ruin the theme of the other paper I wanted to write with the extension.</p>

<p>If this happened to me it would make me uncomfortable, as if my confidence has been breached. I don't know if this feeling is justified. This feeling stems from my view of arXiv. My personal theory is that arXiv is an informal medium, unlike journals and conferences, and in that sense it is no different from other channels of informal communication. It allows for structured and faster dissemination of work (thus inform the ongoing work of others), in addition to establishing priority of results, but that does not grant it a formal status. I think an author should exercise restraint in extending results from arXiv, and apply the same standards that he would if he were to encounter the work through classical informal channels.</p>

<p><strong>What would be expected</strong> to be provided for presenters who are accepted? We're a non-profit, funded only by fees for the conferences, so have never budgeted for honorariums, lodging for speakers or their expenses.

<p><strong>How long a presentation</strong> would be acceptable from the speaker's perspective? I expect we'd be interested in presentations of 15-20 minutes, as the topic would be rather specific (such as a presentation on the actions of a single military unit rather than on the campaign in general).</p>

<p>I suffer from a long term chronic illness which means currently I cannot work full-time. I manage 75% of full-time hours  working on my PhD currently, so while I am well enough to do research, I am not well enough to do as much as I'd like. I am concerned that, should my health not improve, this will prove problematic as I try to move from being a student to an employee. My academic output would likely be less than an able-bodied person in the same position. While it may be of the same quality, there would be less of it. </p>

I used to study Bioengineering/Bioinformatics—from which I hold a publication—before switching to CS. I suffered from an extensive period of burnout and some personal problems starting my second year in college—after getting a 3.30 in my freshman year, not exactly an upward trend in my grades in following years either—resulting in my current CGPA.

There is <a href=""http://www.bracha.org/pluggable-types.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this work by Bracha</a> on pluggable / optional type systems, e.g.  for scripting languages. The student wants to solve the same problem that these 'pluggable typesystem' solves. But he is using dependent-type theory, i.e., to check that values in the scripting language are valid according to a given type. This can solve (or better solve) problems related to scripting languages (e.g. security problems in web programming; because everything is basically a string in scripting languages).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find it hard to come up with a concise research question. (And possibly also with a method to evaluate the approach).</p>

<p>So, my question is: </p>

<ul>
<li>Are there any references that can help me to formulate valid research 
questions? </li>
</ul>

<p>The closest reference I have found is <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=776925"" rel=""nofollow"">this mini-tutorial</a> by Mary Shaw.</p>

3089,"<p>Although I am an active user of SE, I have chosen to remain anonymous because of the nature of this question. I am currently a graduate student at a university that lands in the mid 70s among U.S. News' top graduate schools in mathematics, which by my understanding is very poor. My grades were quite good and although I didn't do terrifically on the subject GRE, I had a few offers from schools in the mid 40 range which I turned down. This was partially because I think I undervalued the importance of choosing a better school, and for a variety of personal reasons. My university has some unique opportunities in applied math, but is otherwise unremarkable.</p>

<p>As I enter my second year, I am increasingly convinced that a career as an active research mathematician is what I want for myself. However, I've heard so much contradictory information that I'm unsure if this is a realistic goal given the status of my university. While a variety of people have told me that there are plenty of desirable jobs available in ""industry,"" the general consensus is that graduate students from low-ranking schools tend to end up as community college professors. The fact that most universities (including my own) are full of doctors from strictly high ranking schools seems to support this.</p>

<p>I have the chance to receive a terminal masters at the end of this year, rather than continue on for another four and complete my PhD, so I'm considering trying to retake the GRE and reapplying (I am unclear whether this is frowned upon in the math community in general, although at my school I have been reassured it is not). On the other hand, my university has a few professors who seem to be well known within their niche, mainly because their particular specialties are very unique.</p>

<p>My general questions are these: How important is the quality of the university when it comes to having a full career in pure mathematics research? Is a well known adviser a factor, possibly outweighing the school? Is this significantly different among applied mathematicians?</p>

3124,"<p>I find myself in an awkward situation. Nearly two years ago I submitted a paper to a reputable mathematics journal. After 15 months it was rejected with the rationale that there had been papers published (most since the submission date) that contained results that I should have referenced. I found that a little spurious, but moved on and put my work together with some colleagues and got our new paper accepted (pending some language issues) by a different journal.</p>

<p>However, one of my co-authors has found that my exact result (barring some small notational changes, but with the exact same language; I can recognise it as mine, I slaved over finding just the right words!) from my original paper has had the proof published in a book by one author of the references that caused the paper to get originally rejected!</p>

<p>My assumption is thus that the paper was sent to this person to referee and they liked the result so much that they kept it for themselves, which also explains the delay in refereeing... I believe that this author has also presented this result at a conference as their own work. They have a number of papers published on the topic in question from their doctoral thesis.</p>

<p>My question is what steps can I take now to re-assert my authorship?</p>

<p>I believe that it would have been simpler if I had also submitted it to the arXiv, but I wasn't sure (at that time) how that would be seen by the journal. I did give a presentation of my results at a local conference, so I would be able to produce credible witnesses to back up my claim, if necessary. The book published containing my work is largely the doctoral thesis of the author, so I am attempting to find a copy of the thesis since it was deposited before I submitted my paper to the journal.

<p>I already have a BS and MS in chemistry with a minor in applied math.I published three papers during my MS, one first author in the top journal in my specialty and two as coauthor in an average and a so-so journal.  I hope those will count for something.  I finished my BS with around 3.1 and my MS with a 3.9 gpa.  I'm sure that my MS advisor would write me a great letter.  My GRE scores are too old to count so I'd have to retake it or try and get a pass on it since I already have a graduate degree.  Since finishing school I've been working for 4 years as a chemist.  I can get great recommendations from my supervisor who is a PhD chemist.    </p>

<p>I've been working for a while to cover some of the things I would have learned in a BSEE to try and make up for my lack of one.  I worked through some texts on analog/digital design, lots and lots of programming, built a balancing robot that got a bit of internet attention, and I'm currently working on an autonomous robotics project that's looking really good so far.  After that I have more project ideas than I have time or money for.  </p>

<p>My experience in academia was teaching Computer Science for four years at a mostly liberal arts college, and that was 30 years ago.
I frankly found the world of work to provide more challenging intellectual stimulation, at least in the sort of practical issues I cared most about.</p>

<p>There are highly technical issues in software development that I and other practitioners have discovered that are quite orthogonal (to say the least) to the trend of publishing in those areas.
So when I try to publish it is hard to build much of a bibliography.
When I submit (through an online submittal process) I tend to get responses that vary in quality, but are generally negative.</p>

<p>I am tempted to revise, in such a way as to address the concerns raised by the better quality reviews.
I could buttress the claims with stronger mathematical arguments, but it's hard to tell if this would make the paper more or less approachable.</p>

<p>Then there's the question whether I should resubmit to the same journal.
There don't really seem to be any others at the same level of relevance to practitioners.</p>

By different people I mean the advisor, graduate students and PhD students.</p>

This question is important since a postdoc cannot just wait for the adviser to give him/her inputs.

3475,"<p>I have a question about two possible career paths, for which I was unable to come up a better title. Let me explain what I mean:</p>

<p>Path 1, Working in an area: By this I mean, <em>making a career</em> by adding to the knowledge of a field of study. This may include sorting out open questions in that field or identifying new issues or pushing the boundaries of existing knowledge. This typically involves having a larger perspective and understanding of the field and its relevance to the world. </p>

<p>Path 2, Working on problems: By this I mean <em>making a career</em> by solving a series of specific challenging problems not necessarily belonging to a common field of study. Here one only attempts to understand enough about the problem at hand to solve the problem, but does not show an interest in developing the area as such.</p>

<p>Working in an area requires one to have a broader vision, scholarship and commitment to the development of the area. Working on problems does not involve commitment, but requires one to repeated invest oneself in learning about a new area. By working in an area one can encounter a degree of monotony. By working on problems, one can potentially find new challenges at every juncture.</p>

<p>So my question is: career wise, what is a better option? Specifically, which of these kind of academics are more valued by the community? What, if any, are pitfalls of these paths?
Meta question: is path 2 a path at all or do all academics eventually settle into path 1 after spending some time on path 2?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I guess the key difference between the two paths is that path 1 leads one to become an ""expert"" with extensive knowledge in a particular area. Path 2 exposes one to a variety of problem situations and makes one a better problem solver, though it may not make one an expert in any field. For the purpose of this question, you may take the area to be a well studied field such as, say integer programming, which has some long-standing open problems, but is not necessarily so young that it allows for a variety of research opportunities.</p>

<p>When doing a literature review at the start of a process of addressing a specific problem, it's easy to miss related material, if I don't know that it <strong>is</strong> related.</p>

<p><strong>The example</strong></p>

<p>Let's say I'm looking at a particular electricity-generation  problem relating to pollution costs (in a very broad sense), of combustion and cooling: there might be relevant papers about,  say, biodiversity and temperature in river water, that I don't know about, and haven't made the connection to, and it appears in a journal well outside the field of electricity generation.</p>

<p>However, within the literature, there will be authors whose papers span those fields: work on valuing biodiversity (so that loss of biodiversity represents a quantifiable cost), and the effect on biodiversity of changing river temperatures (so that using river-cooling in electricity generation, has a deleterious effect on river biodiversity).</p>

<p><strong>The proposition</strong></p>

<p>It should be possible, by doing an analysis of keywords, of co-authorship, and of journals, to automate the building of a network of subjects and of authors, to map out interconnections between specific narrow subject areas, and find the people that work in those interconnecting areas.</p>

<p>Is there such a network map of subjects and authors, anywhere? Not just for this specific example, but one that spans a very wide range of literature (e.g. Engineering, Science, Technology, Economics). Ideally, one that gets updated frequently, based on ongoing publications?</p>

<p>I'm asking this question in relation to my doctoral studies in Germany. However, my question may be relevant to regulations in other European countries.</p>

<p>At the university where I pursue my doctorate, I have the choice between two titles. Upon successfully completion of my dissertation and all related examinations I can decide which title I want to hold: ""Dr. rer. nat."" or ""Ph.D."".</p>

<p>In Germany, the traditional title is ""Dr."". From what I understand the title ""Ph.D."" is being introduced at many universities for reasons of comparability with degrees from other countries (especially with the US and the UK). I'm guessing, the reasoning is that holding a ""Ph.D."" will improve your chances when applying for (academic) openings internationally. However, I have also been told that the German ""Dr."" has an excellent international reputation and may give you an edge over ""Ph.D."".</p>

<p>EDIT: A couple of years ago, legal steps were taken so that a ""Ph.D."" issued by other European countries is automatically recognized in Germany (as long as the issuing institutions are eligible) and may be ""translated"" to ""Dr."" in Germany. There is also a question related to this <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/1930/eu-ph-d-in-germany-calling-yourself-dr-or-ph-d"">here</a>. However, a ""Ph.D."" issued in Germany may <em>not</em> be ""translated"" to ""Dr.""! Therefore, I have to decide for either one and <em>cannot</em> use both.</p>

<p>Hence, my question is: <strong>What are the advantages and disadvantages of either title with respect to academic careers in Germany and internationally?</strong> Is a ""Ph.D."" seen as less distinguished by German academics? How is the German ""Dr."" perceived by academics in other countries as compared with a ""Ph.D.""?</p>

I didn't have to pay anything, and the rights were granted instantly after completing the form, but it was still a hassle. The biggest hassle is having to go to each journal's website to check their policies. Hence the questions: </p>

3701,"<p>I am writing a master thesis of about 80-100 pages and want to know a good way of structuring my document either using only chapters or chapters and ""parts"". f first wanted to post this question to the <a href=""http://tex.stackexchange.com"">TeX Stack Exchange</a> but realized that it was too philosophical. </p>

<p>As most thesis writers I use LaTeX and I have seen thesis templates that use <code>\part</code> (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/classicthesis/"">classicthesis</a>) and ones that do not (master thesis template from a university). I think that classicthesis is mostly aimed at PhD thesis documents that are longer and will become a ""book"".</p>

<p>So when is it appropriate to use <code>\part</code>? Any specific document length in pages or number of chapters? </p>

<p>When you use <code>\part</code> then a page is cleared after the text. Is this a style that is used in American PhD thesis documents? Why is this done?</p>

<p>I have also looked at some textbooks and they often do not have something similar to part. Instead these books only use chapters. One of my favorite textbooks (<em>Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach</em> by Russel) uses parts but no actual pages that show the parts name. Instead they are only visible in the table of contents.</p>

<p>My two competing ideas are with and without parts:</p>

<pre><code>   \chapter{Introduction}
\part{Concepts}
   \chapter{Background}
   \chapter{Related work}
\part{Methods and systems}

   \chapter{Implementation}
\part{Evaluation}

<p>Is is at all appropriate for me to use Google (partly also Google Scholar) for academic research, just because I have good experiences with it in my personal, non-professional environment? I noticed I feel slightly too comfortable in sourcing material via Google.

Of course for many topics this is a non-issue, but for my current topic, a lot of government, international institution and NGO content was ""on-topic"" and needed, so that is how the situation came about in the first place.</p>

<p>While I definitely <strong>won't use</strong> Wikipedia or (online) newspapers, but I also came across e.g. OECD content: while the content itself is strong and academically valid, <strong>by now I sadly had to discard a significant part of it</strong>, also because I initially didn't (exclusively) use their ""iLibrary"". Specifically: The amount of time I had to spend trying to find e.g. the author of such non-journal content (and other source-data), trying to decide if I should invest my time into reading and citing the content vs. discarding it and that I have to enter bibliographic data by hand for such content make me tired.</p>

  <p>I would like to provide for you in written form what is expected from you as a member of the research group. In addition to the usual work-day schedule, I expect all of the members of the group to work evenings and weekends. You will find that this is the norm here at Caltech. On occasion, I understand that personal matters will make demands on your time which will require you to be away from your responsibilities to the laboratory. However, it is not acceptable to me when it becomes a habit.</p>
  
  <p><strong>I have noticed that you have failed to come in to lab on several weekends, and more recently have failed to show up in the evenings.</strong> Moreover, in addition to such time off, you recently requested some vacation. I have no problem with vacation time that is well earned, but I do have a problem with continuous vacation and time off that interferes with the project. I find this very annoying and disruptive to your science.</p>
  
  <p><strong>I expect you to correct your work-ethic immediately.</strong></p>
  
  <p>I receive at least one post-doctoral application each day from the US and around the world. If you are unable to meet the expected work-schedule, I am sure that I can find someone else as an appropriate replacement for this important project.</p>

<p>I have fallen prey to this during my PhD, doing very long hours. Now that I manage a research team, what is good advice to help fight this culture in my team? (Obviously, I don't want students and post-docs to get the message that little work is required either.)</p>

<p>Things I already do to that end:</p>

<ul>
<li>When a new group member comes in and they get the out-of-hours building pass (for Sundays and late nights), mention that they are not expected to use it on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Avoid planning meetings at unusual hours (bank holidays, week-ends, etc.)</li>

While many research papers often contain many keywords in intro and abstract of a paper (for retelling recent history in a field), which makes finding papers in a special context impossible (measuring effect X with method Y on material Z), in principle the AROUND(x) operator gives you this power back.</p>

<p>The problem is, google SCHOLAR hasn't implemented the <a href=""http://googlesystem.blogspot.in/2010/12/googles-around-operator.html"">AROUND</a> operator, therefore I currently use it sometimes in google WEB search when searching papers (unfortunately only titles and abstracts are indexed by Google, but main body content isn't searchable) in a very specific context.</p>

<p>I'm really wondering if there are secret hacks for free (google scholar, scirus...) and commercial (ISI, scopus) search engines giving you the power of context-sensitive search, as it would make a lot of reading, searching, filtering, rating, sharing unnecessary.</p>

<p>My current way to solve this is downloading many highly-cited papers (withoud reading) as gerrit's answer shows and indexing it with my own desktop search engine (Copernic desktop search software) which has a similar operator.

Maybe we should similar to thecostofknowledge just start to build our own search engines?

<p>What would your opinion be on taking a letter of recommendation from a professor who has already recommended you on LinkedIn then? </p>

  <p>Third, the letter of recommendation, when completed, becomes an
  education record.  Both the paper copy and e-file are education
  records… and it makes no difference where they are filed.  Since FERPA
  grants the student the right to inspect any education record, there is
  also an unwritten obligation to notify the writer of this right.</p>
  
  <p>In this latter instance, the placement office, or student, should
  initially provide each writer with the knowledge that the student has
  either waived, or not waived, his right to subsequently review the
  letter.  This knowledge may influence what the writer includes in the
  letter.  It may persuade the person to whom a reference request was
  made to politely decline to write the letter.  Unfortunately, letter
  writers do not have the same rights that students have in the
  letter-writing process.</p>

Now, when you post a recommendation on LinkedIn, it will be displayed(provided the student accepts the recommendation).

On the advice of a senior colleague, I decided that I do not want to publish the paper anymore and with that journal. I wrote the editor several times; he has received the emails, but refuses to reply. I know he gets the emails because if its on other matters he has replied but not on the paper.

5170,"<p>I work in the Computing and Mathematics School at my university (UK). This year the School has adopted a fairly aggressive policy regarding student attendance. If a student has a poor – or zero – attendance rate, the student is contacted and a dialogue opened. This has many benefits including identifying those students who have possible  undiscovered or undeclared learning difficulties. </p>

<p>If a student’s attendance rate remains poor following a first intervention, a process of issuing formal warnings commences, culminating with the withdrawal of the student if the student does not start to engage with their course.</p>

<p>Attendance is presently monitored at all laboratory and tutorial sessions. Attendance is not presently monitored for lectures. </p>

<p>Our current system comprises a series of shared Google spreadsheets which contains the details of all students for all classes. Staff members enter attendance manually into the spreadsheet for their class.</p>

<p>The difficulty with this system is that there is presently no automatic link between the existing official university student record database and the attendance register spreadsheets. This means if students change groups, enrol late, withdraw, change course or units, all this information must be dealt with in a robust manner. Currently, such changes are implemented manually. This means errors are likely to be introduced into the attendance register.</p>

<p>I notice that there are a number of commercial attendance monitoring solutions available which are based on hardware, e.g. <a href=""http://www.telepen.co.uk/onyx_collector.htm"">Telepen</a>. I would be interested in anyone’s experience with such systems, however I don’t forsee these to be ultimately workable in my case owing to the large cost. </p>

<p>I am interested in software solutions. If your institution monitors student attendance, do you use any specialist software? If so, what do you use?</p>

<p>Another option – a preferable one – is to work within the existing university data systems.
All the necessary information regarding student details and activities is available. The problem arises when we try to ensure our ad hoc attendance register contains up to date student information. Ideally we’d use our Virtual Learning Environment to enter attendance data. Our VLE is Moodle. Are there any Moodle users out there who use Moodle to record attendance?</p>

My former supervisor has basically edited and published my work under his name.  The papers are different but only in the way that an interim and final draft are different - the structure is the same and some sentences were either paraphrased or identical.</p>

<p>The analysis and final recommendations are also identical, he did not supplement my analysis with his own. Although, the analysis process was a collaborative process, I was the one who did the VAST majority of the writing with him chiming in occasionally about what he did/did not like. The basic distribution of labour was: he conceived of the project, did the interviews, made comments on drafts, performed the final edit and responded to peer review questions. I performed the analysis, performed the literature review and wrote the bulk of the paper.  </p>

It also fits in the scope of a conference whose deadline is in 2 months.  Here are my options. </p>

- there is more time to explore and think about research questions and goals, as opposed to Europe where you join to develop a certain project
- the stipend and the US is very low also compared to the living costs especially on the West Coast. It would mean five years of financial sacrifice

Yet, he himself is not very well known in my particular field, he is in his own application field though. The University is in California with what I guess is a standard PostDoc salary for a one year Post Doc program.</p>

<p>The other is to stay in my current University, with my professor in a more stable and long term proposal (4 years). The problem, is that my professor was never very engaged in my project, and I got mostly marginal help from him. He was always really helpful, and had good resources (conferences, equipment, etc).</p>

<p>I would like to know the opinion of more experienced people. I would really like a future in academia, so I'm open to any suggestion.</p>

5272,"<p>I work in the field of chemistry, where some of the prominent publishers have very invasive (or restrictive) copyright transfer agreements. Thus, I'm considering the use of amendments (or addenda) to publication agreements, such as the one <a href=""http://libraries.mit.edu/sites/scholarly/mit-open-access/open-access-at-mit/mit-amendment-form/"">proposed by the MIT libraries</a>. However, I don't really want to spend a lot of time on an unwinnable pursuit, so I was wondering: is there somewhere a decent review of the success of such amendments? I expect that it may vary from publisher to publisher, and from field to field, but is there <em>any</em> data at all? (My own searches couldn't turn much.) In particular, what about the “big names”, such as Elsevier, Wiley, etc?</p>

5275,"<p>Firstly I hope this question is appropriate to ask here. I am a third year studying Mathematics at the University of Oxford, with plans to continue to 4th year to complete the masters course.</p>

<p>I have been considering many paths to take so far this year, I started off by looking into finance, this I found however incredibly unintellectuality stimulating. My passions have always been for Maths and Physics, this year I will be studying quantum theory, quantum computing, special relativity and fluid dynamics, which I will continue on into 4th year with the addition of general relativity, theoretical physics and other more general applied courses.</p>

<p>I'm very interested in applying for a PhD after 4th year, mainly because i've never been more fascinated by the subjects i'm currently learning, Quantum theory in particular is amazing and has really changed the way I look at the universe.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I'm only getting a mid 2.1, however it is from Oxford so I hope that this may carry some weight, but because of this I will be mainly focusing on applying to universities other than Oxford and Cambridge.</p>

<p>What I'm wondering is is there any point in following this dream? I'm extremely motivated but I feel not having a first might have ruined it for me. Can anyone recommend any strategies I can use to make myself more competitive?</p>

<p>Currently i'm planning on applying to universities for summer research assistant placements, paid/unpaid. I'm also reading the Feynman lectures to boost my background knowledge of physics, to help bridge the gap between physics courses and my mathematics course. Can anyone recommend any other books/ideas that could help me be able to apply for experimental physics? Also universities with departments that would be good to approach.</p>

<p>To sum up my long and laboured question, i'm extremely passionate about mathematical physics and the idea of stopping learning about it, and say going into a deskjob is sort of horrifying. Any advice anyone can give me I would greatly appreciate.</p>

5301,"<p>My earliest PhD graduation date is 10 months away. Funding permits me to stay 1–3 months longer, so the final date is still uncertain.</p>

<p>It is never too early to make contacts for possible post-docs. But how long in advance is too early to formally apply to post-doc job openings or funding opportunities? Depending on the bureaucracy, the path from applying to starting can probably be anything from a week up to a year — someone I know is applying with <a href=""http://www.esa.int/"">ESA</a> which had the opening advertised in August, application deadline in October, will have interviews in December/January, and the commencement of work only in September, 13 months after the initial job advertisement. My personal guess is that the long time between interviews and starting is to create a level playing field between those who do and those who don't need to go through a visa application procedure.</p>

<p>If I'm too early in applying for a post-doc, a hosting institution might prefer someone who can start earlier and where the graduation date is more certain. For example, in my case the graduation date is still uncertain, so there is a risk in accepting even if they are willing to wait. Project funding might also require the money to be spent rather soon.</p>

<p>If I wait too long, there might be a considerable period where I'm between jobs. Having a long (>6 months) period between jobs is a disadvantage for me. Maybe it's also a disadvantage for a hosting institution (I'm not sure).</p>

<p>So, even though I'm no longer a grad student, I sometimes have the feeling that I tend to be a more negative reviewer than others, but it's actually hard to measure (maybe I'm just reviewing mostly bad papers?!), since I don't always have access to the other reviews of the papers I'm reviewing (due to the fact that I've been more often acting as an external reviewer than as a PC member). </p>

<p>I believe that the quality of my writing has improved with the feedback I've received from the reviewers of my paper, but because I don't have any feedback on my reviews, it's hard to know if and how I can improve them. So my question is: <strong>is there a way to measure my own reviewing bias?</strong> </p>

<p>The first thing that would come to my mind would be a set of papers reviewed by many other reviewers, and a result like: ""you're in the x% more negative reviewers"". Of course, I'm not implying that I would be automatically less severe when reviewing, but sometimes, in case of doubt, it's good to know one's own bias. </p>

5579,"<p>I am considering pursuing a PhD in computer science one day.  What I am deciding now is what I want to...I guess specialize in (is that the way to put it)?  What I want to focus my research efforts on.</p>

<p>A couple of things I am interested in are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Something involving manned/unmanned space exploration (writing guidance/navigation systems for the next Mars rover, etc).</li>
<li>Using Computer Science to find cures for diseases (folding @ home).</li>
<li>Computer models of climate change, as I am very much a ""Global Warming is real and needs to be dealt with yesterday"" kind of guy.</li>
</ol>

<p>But this questions isn't ""what should I do research in"" but more of ""how can I decide what I should do research in.""</p>

<p>I know a lot of people will counter with ""if you don't know what you want to research then you shouldn't be considering getting a PhD"", but I don't believe in that line of reasoning.  I know I want to do research.  I know I want to be involved with something that expands the boundaries of Computer Sciences as we know it.  Just because I am not exactly sure what avenue I should go down in doing so, doesn't in any way change how much I know that I do want to do it.</p>

<p>So my question is, where to start with figuring out what I should eventually specialize in?  What are my theoretical options?  Where can I see if ""getting my PhD to write software to guide probes to Jupiter"" is even a viable option?  Must I choose a area that is currently being researched at the university I attend, or am I free to come up with my own?  Can/should I be reading recently released papers on Computer Science topics for some inspiration, and if so where do I go to find those?</p>

5585,"<p>The title is fairly generic in nature, so I'm trying to elaborate in the body. I'm interested in answers pertaining to Theoretical Computer Science (TCS), but I'm certain the question would be equally relevant in fields which have been around for more than a couple of decades, and hence I hope to get responses from researchers in other disciplines as well!</p>

<p>What I'm trying to understand is how researchers (who have been working for quite sometime) in any specialized field (like TCS) keep track of results that have already been published - not just seminal results, but also results which have a lesser (but not insignificant) impact on the field but were published years or decades before. At the same time, one has to keep track of results being published in (at least) the notable conferences in the current year as well, in order to absorb the new ideas presented there and incorporate/extend them in one's own work.</p>

<p>I find it kind of incredible to believe that all of the above is possible without any kind of disciplined approach to reading and subsequent assimilation of the ideas on a regular basis - which is why I'm asking members of academia about their experiences/practices on this. In particular:</p>

<ol>
<li>How frequently (if at all) do you revisit ""classic"" results?</li>
<li>Do you keep written/electronic notes on a regular basis to keep track of continuing progress in a field (say, for instance, inapproximability results for geometric problems) - or do you prefer to keep it all in your mind?</li>
<li>To keep track of current state of art, do you only attend/read Tier-I conferences, or do you get useful ideas from results published in Tier-II/III conferences as well?</li>
<li>What kind of time/resources would you typically set aside for reading, as opposed to working on a problem?</li>
</ol>

<p>In short, I'm trying to find what kind of things would you expect a top researcher to ""know"" off the top of his head, and at what level of depth - and how would you go trying to maintain that level of perception over the years?</p>

<p>(I understand that the question <strong>IS</strong> subjective, but I'm hoping that it satisfies the guidelines for a ""<a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/"">good subjective</a>"" question!)</p>

5615,"<p>The topics that have been in my research focus recently have problems with consistent naming and terminology through time and papers, so I might perceive it as a greater problem than I would normally, but still. I am a PhD in Computer Science, Image Analysis -- so while there's a <em>lot of standard terminology</em>, a <em>lot</em> of state-of-the-art <em>terminology has not settled on unique names yet</em>.</p>

<p>Until now, at least all the papers made by the same author/research group/under the same adviser (same last author) I've read have been consistent in their terminology (at least the one describing their main contribution). But, the latest article from an interesting author has <em>changed his own terminology on purpose</em> (he says so explicitly himself).</p>

<p><strong>What would be a good reason for terminology change within the scope of one's own work?</strong> It's not merging work with somebody -- in fact, the article I'm talking about is the first standalone work from that author after publishing with an adviser during PhD. From my point of view, it just makes it less findable: the key words changed, which might in turn cause less people to read it and in the end cite it. <em>How can this be beneficial?</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I am actually interested in a <em>general set of guidelines</em> for when changing one's own terminology might be beneficial, but let me add the details of the case that inspired the question. It's the terminology to describe a data structure constructed for an image:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the first 4-5 publications (during the PhD, before publishing the thesis), the terminology was <em>new</em>, the name was <em>suggestive</em> and <em>conforming</em> to the other terminology from the same filed, but still <em>different than other data structures</em> with <em>similar</em> purpose and of similar format.</p></li>
<li><p>The latest publication (1 author only) <em>takes over</em> some terminology from a related work, and introduces ambiguity. That terminology was <em>first used to regard components of a similar</em>, but still <em>different</em> data structure. No attempt was made to prove that those similar structures were equivalent (and I think they're not -- still didn't get around to proving that). A new term was created, derived from the terms for components.</p>

<p>Now to me a stronger suggestion is that <em>similar but different</em> data structure used as a basis for terminology, rather than what it was actually meant to describe.</p></li>

<p>I was wondering what was the general agreement when changing position with unfinished project.  I see three main possibilities here:</p>

<ol>
<li>At the beginning of the new contract, I spend <strong>all my time finishing the previous project</strong> so I do not have to worry about them for too long (but I do not start right away to work for my new boss)</li>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> After much dilly-dallying, I have finally zoned in to pursue lifetime in Taoist research. I have studied mathematical philosophy, cultural anthropology, symbolic logic and enrolled in Eastern studies class for next semester. I understand the professor for latter class would be an excellent source of reference but currently semester is closed.</p>

<p><strong>Problems facing:</strong> As I learned in English class it is important to take copious notes during research even if it means 24 hours so I am currently photographing everything that pertains to Taoism. But due to the complex nature of the subject itself and the concept of <em>wu-wei</em>, action in non-action, I am unsure as to how to approach research. I understand if I pursue degree in this field I should familiarize myself with the language and journals and pretty much everything that is related to it. This brings me to my original point:</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What would be a good strategy to do research on Taoism? Do I conceive of a thesis and work downwards from it? Or do I start from the scratch - so to speak- and bootstrap my way to a knowledge base. Problem with latter and given the complex nature is if I start with no thesis, then it would be an aimless wandering. But- then again, isn't that what Taoism is all about? </p>

As I was reading some articles cited in one of these theses, I discovered that this person had lifted large blocks of text from the cited works verbatim. Though the quotes were cited, they were presented as paraphrases, not quotes. I checked a few more, just out of curiosity, and realized that basically the whole literature review by this author (who graduated with a PhD two years ago) was cut-and-paste verbatim quotes strung together. (And who knows how much more of the thesis is unoriginal - I only checked this one chapter) This really ticks me off, as I (and many with me) spend what feels like eons of time reworking cited information into proper paraphrases. I happen to know the offending author's adviser pretty well, as we currently work together outside of my graduate program. Should I say something, or should I just let this person get away with copying and pasting large parts of their dissertation? </p>

Turnitin only counts exact matches, so the 52% doesn't even cover some of the paragraphs I myself caught, where the author has changed one or two words but kept the sentence structure.

6001,"<p>I have just completed my PhD. Although my examiners did not raise any concerns, I have been grappling with an ethical issue for the entire duration of my candidature. </p>

<p>The issue concerns professional knowledge of the field on which my research is based. This is an issue of concern because I am employed in the field and have access to information that is generally not publicly available (but is available to me as an employee) or only found in hard-to-get industry publications (e.g. newsletters). These publications are hard-to-get because of their specialised nature and limited circulation. </p>

<p>Disclosing this information creates a potential conflict of interest for me (because of reasons associated with commercial-in-confidence, breach of trust etc.). It gets even worse because I am often actively involved in generating this information as part of various negotiations I am required to have with third parties (in my capacity as an employee). As an example, I draft policy speeches for my CEO so this has the effect of quoting my own work in my dissertation (but attributed to my CEO in the citation and bibliography!)  </p>

<p>To resolve this matter, I have declared (categorically) this conflict of interest (several times in my dissertation) (although I don't identify myself as the ghost writer). I have also put whatever information I thought could be ethically disclosed in the relevant context (e.g. cited the publicly available newsletter, where possible). This was to ensure future researchers could benefit from this 'inside' knowledge. I have stated this as one of the contributions to knowledge that my dissertation is making.</p>

<p>I must add that the professional knowledge does not contradict or undermine my research, so I am certainly not withholding the information for this reason. On the contrary, this information enhances the main arguments of my study (so omitting it presents a significant dilemma for me).</p>

<p>i would love to hear how else could this matter be resolved.</p>

However, since I've realized I don't want to go into the experimental side of physics, I am trying to avoid having to take a lab course. This isn't possible while staying in the stream I'm in right now, but due to my elective and other choices in regards to the mathematics courses I took thus far, I am still eligible to switch into Mathematical Physics. I've looked at the requirements and the courses I'd now need to take when compared to the ones I'd need to take if I stayed in the regular stream are basically the ones I would use up my electives on anyway. Thus, the only qualitative change arising from switching the programs would be that I would be able to avoid that final lab course, and could take another course, say, biophysics or a maths course, instead.</p>

<p>My concern, however, is what impact would this have in regards to my going to grad school or looking for jobs?

Does ""Physics"" look better than ""Mathematical Physics"" in certain cases? If so, when would that be? In other words, is mathematical physics looked down upon as being esoteric? </p>

Basically: every week during your first two years, you have two oral exams, each lasting one hour, with one teacher examining two or three students, each using a blackboard. A science student would typically have math and chemistry on week A, then physics and another topic (engineering, foreign language, …) on week B.

6170,"<p>I'm not sure where to ask this so I thought I'd ask you guys.</p>

<p>I'm in my 3rd year at uni doing maths and some of the modules are a bit tricky. I know this and I know the way that I need to work in order to understand the material and pass the exams well. Due to this, I try and spend  a lot of time learning the theory (and recently its been through loads of questions on here). However, what I noticed with some of my friends is that they don't put in the same amount of effort as me (quality wise).</p>

<p>Let's take the example on semi direct products. A lot of us have been struggling with constructing SDP's however I've tried very hard to learn the theory on them and what the answer's are looking for and what the methods I need to do (and why I'm doing them) to try and learn how to construct them. A lot of that has been on here but I've been referring to online PDF's and lecture notes as well. Now, my friends know that I put this in and try and learn it and so I can do the work properly, so I think they're trying to take advantage of that. </p>

<p>Today I showed one person how to do a question regarding compositions on Mobius transforms and they just refused to think for themselves. I said ""think about it, because I'm not going to tell you what the answer is"" and they still wouldn't think (just kept saying ""I don't know""), so I didn't tell them the answer. Eventually, after some BIG hints, they got what to do. Now I've noticed people are relying on me to tell them how to construct SDP's (as this is a main question in the exam). From my history, you can see that I've struggled a lot with this and I think I'm close to solving this problem now, but at the same time I can tell that my friends aren't going to learn it themselves. Mentally they've given up and so won't even bother learning it. </p>

<p>My question is this: <strong>Should I tell them the answer, when (it is when and not if because I WILL get it!) I figure out how to do it?</strong></p>

<p>I feel bad because obviously I don't want to lie and say ""I don't know how to do it"" or mess up their exam, but at the same time, I feel like they had the exact same time as me to do this, and the same resources (online, books, notes, ask the letcurer, etc) yet they still didn't do it. So it's their own fault. Plus, the time it'd take me to teach and explain it to them, I could spend that couple of hours doing my own work. Other examples, revise another module, etc.</p>

<p>What should I do? Do you guys have any tips?</p>

<p>I'm sure you feel like this sometimes when people ask questions on here clearly without thinking about and just expect you to answer it.</p>

I had January 5th written down on my list of application information, but when I looked it was indeed Dec. 15 on the department website.</p>

<p>I distinctly remembered seeing Jan. 5th, however, so I looked it up again and found the website for general graduate admissions where I found the deadline to begin with.

So I emailed my application to the mathematics department graduate admissions email address explaining there was an incorrect deadline on another part of the website, provided a link, and requested that I still be considered.</p>

7200,"<p>I have received a manuscript to review for a journal. The interesting thing is, I had already reviewed this article (exact same title, abstract and author list, almost exact same content) for <em>another</em> journal a few weeks ago where I recommended that it be published, but only after major revisions of both form and content. When I first reviewed it, I wrote a two-page review, listing some questions and several “actionable” comments, ranging from some concerns about exactness of the text (some conclusions didn't seem fully backed by the results) all the way down to trivial stuff (grammar, a few typos, graphic issues with the figures, etc.).</p>

<p>Now, the manuscript has come to me for review again, but it is almost unchanged from the first version. None of the serious stuff has been addressed, and even most of the trivial stuff was not fixed (there's at least one remaining typo, and the figures still aren't fully legible). However, I think this behavior from the authors is clearly a bad signal, which should be somehow conveyed to the editor: they're not willing to amend their work, and would rather do some journal-shopping.</p>

<p>What would you suggest me to do? Should I just re-send my earlier review? Add a note to the editor about my knowledge of the “history” of the paper?

7300,"<p>From my research internship experiences (my previous University didn't really focus on research much) and what my current advisers told me, a <em>general flow</em> of a PhD is like any other long(er)-time project:</p>

<ul>
<li>familiarize oneself with state-of-the-art on the subject</li>
<li><p>generate your own ideas (by trial-and-error) and integrate with current approaches</p>

<p>(with this phase becoming a lot fuzzier the more advanced your ""project"" is)</p></li>
<li>write it up for the world to know.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a fresh PhD student, I'm currently in the middle of familiarizing myself with the state of the art, following the advice of many older students (<em>""be a brave soldier in the beginning and do and read everything your advisers throw/send/e-mail your way""</em>). And I do understand the importance of it (in fact, more often than not, I love it). But, it does give one an impression of self-uselessness sometimes (I have a talk with myself every few weeks or so to remind myself of my motivation and resolve the ""uselessness"" issue).</p>

<p>So, my question is: <strong>Typically, how much time would a fresh PhD student spend on going through state-of-the-art at the beginning of his/her PhD?</strong></p>

<p>And some sub-questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>is it expected/typical to produce some kind of output (articles?) <em>during</em> this period?</li>
<li>what kind of output is expected at the end of this period?</li>
<li>what would be some indicators that this period is ending which a student himself can notice</li>

Now diving deeper and deeper into the field I feel much less motivated to go on. What frustrates me mostly, is how little we really understand of complex biological systems, and all our efforts in the field are essentially just waddling in the darkness, trying to find the ""holy grail"" that may or may not exist.

The first thing he asked me after I was done rambling on, however, was how long it has been since I started. When I told him it's been about a year and a half, he smiled and said ""well, it was about time"". According to him, it's common for a PhD candidate to become jaded with his/her work somewhere between 18-months to 2 years in. He claimed that one simply gets deep enough into the field to see all the potential problems/pitfalls in research, and feel negatively about it all.</p>

7430,"<p>Like many professions, academia is a challenging environment for women. In some disciplines (e.g. computer science), the number of women remains low despite efforts to increase it. Have there been any academic studies on the ways of improving the working conditions for women, specifically focussing on women in academia? As an academic working in hard sciences (i.e. not gender studies), what book or review could I read on the topic, to help me get a better understanding of these issues (and possibly improve my own behavior)?</p>

<p>I'd like to clarify the purpose of reading textbooks. It sounds obvious at first, but what I mean is opaque to me.</p>

<p>I'm currently reading a textbook describing ~35 problem-solving and improvement methods, as part of <a href=""http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/course/t889.htm"">this course</a>. It is densely packed with definitions, ideas, procedures etc. I'm highlighting as I go through and occasionally making notes in the margins.</p>

<p>When I finish reading, I barely remember what I've just read, let alone what I've learned. If I was asked to describe the characteristics of a technique I've just read about, I would struggle to put forward a coherent and strong answer.</p>

<p>Even if I condense my notes and read through them, the problem remains - there are too many 'facts' to learn, remember and regurgitate.</p>

<p>This leads me to ask what the purpose of reading textbooks is. Is it to learn and understand 'facts' <em>and</em> be able to remember them? Or is it to learn and understand? That is, it doesn't necessarily matter if you can't remember, so long as you can understand ideas when you revisit them and can argue them in your work.</p>

<p>For clarity, I'm a distance-learning student with The Open University, so the textbook I'm referring to isn't a <em>traditional</em> textbook, but one that is perhaps closely identified by F'x as a <em>coursework book</em>.

7611,"<p>I often end up frustrated over the pace of my work, or rather the lack of ""worthy"" results. During my feedback talks with my colleagues and superiors I usually get good feedback but I find it distressing that most of it is qualitative arguments.</p>

<p>I sometimes feel like I have not progressed as much as I would have liked to, but not sure how to assess whether or not I have developed ""enough"" over time. Which led me to wonder if it is possible at all to measure how well a PhD student is progressing.</p>

<p>The usual measures in the community appears to be: </p>

<ul>
<li>number of publications</li>
<li>which journals the publications appeared in (or rather the impact factor)</li>
<li>number of hours in the lab (regarding how ""hard-working"" one is)</li>
<li>number of credits taken from courses during phd studies</li>
</ul>

<p>I personally find none of the above to be a good measure. Publications are a fact of research, or the goal rather. But they should not a be measure of how well a PhD candidate is doing in research. I believe the pragmatic demand on ""more publications"" has essentially lead to overall lower quality and novelty in individual publications. But even without that subjective comment, it should not be a revelation to anyone here that the amount of publications (and especially in which journals they are published) is more dependent on the seniors on the paper rather than the grad student who wrote it.</p>

<p>As for the other two measures I point to, they are just too naive variables to mean much. I mean you can be in the lab for 18h a day, but not learn much new or even worse not even remember those things you have learned. Besides one can also argue whether or not it's actually better for a grad student to be obsessed with number of hours in the lab, or courses taken. </p>

7620,"<p>I am teaching a freshman science course for the first time and I am doing also outreach activities in high schools. To be able to attract the young generation to science one has to connect the concepts with everyday applications.</p>

<p>So I build my power point slides using pictures from the textbooks which we officially use. Unfortunately when one does a Google search on any subject by images, one gets much more appealing and fascinating pictures. Some of these pictures are even related to simple applications which are explained in popular science sites on very recent discoveries. The problem is that I cannot use those pictures from Google sites in my slides because they are copyrighted.</p>

<p>What should I do then? Should I stick to the boring-looking textbook pics to avoid copyright problems, or bring life to my course by using images Google shows up (but then I might go to the jail!)?</p>

<p>Is there something that says one can use images shown by Google for educational purposes with no copyright issues?</p>

7641,"<p>I'm teaching a programming course with ~20 students, guiding them through coding assignments and helping them understand what they are doing, and why it works or doesn't. Tasks expected of them range from trivial to medium-complexity in the range of a 40-hours curriculum.</p>

<p>Now, toward the end of the course, they know enough to solve moderate programming problems. In order to get them to work on a few things more ""exciting"" than what we offer them, I am considering asking them to join an online coding (or problem-solving-through-coding) competition, such as Project Euler. I wouldn't expect them to be able to solve all problems, of course, but I could select a list of problems for them to pick from. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For this session, you are expected to solve between 5 and 10 problems from the following selection of Project Euler numbers: 1-10, 13, 15, 20-24, 26-29, 33, 35-38.</p>

Finally, I have some hope that a few students might actually get into it, and continue doing it for fun after the course.</p>

I usually find this encouraging, and at times it helps me increase productivity by incorporating blogging into my research work-flow and feeling like I am able to communicate with people before having complete results. Sometimes even receive feedback (although my blog is not at the level of regular commentators, and nowhere close to the comment activity I see on popular blogs that I follow).</p>

<p>There is one member of the research group that did quite a lot of work on what I am supposed to modify. So I asked him if he could share his work and code with me. He told me that it is still unpublished work and there is no way he is going to give me his code. He said this is the way he does research.</p>

<p>I'm sort of stumped and don't know what to do. He told me that I should go and do it on my own what he has done for about a year now.

<p>Is there a way that I can persuade this person to collaborate with me, or am I banging my head against a wall?</p>

<p>So just to clarify. My supervisor is (one of) the project lead. I first talked to the supervisor suggesting, then talked to the person who rejected, then to the supervisor again. This project has been going on for a year. There are about 5 people working on it in this lab. I joined the lab to extend on the work done here and to contribute in the final stages of the project. To my surprise, there is no shared code repository, but rather each person does their own thing and in meetings discuss it.</p>

<p>I told the person that I will not steal his code. He replied to me that he doesn't share the code because I will not understand it. I told him that it helps me understand the work by looking at the code. He told me that no.</p>

<p>So my plan is to read the draft papers again and try to understand it that way, then try again in a few days. I don't want to re implement the same thing he has done...</p>

<p>I was given access today to the research group server and I could view everyone's work (around 15 people) and all project material... except his directory and implementation which is permission denied.

He kept telling me that this is his work, and he is the first person on the paper and I should do something else or re-implement the whole code on my own.</p>

7886,"<p>I'm at a North American, state-run university (not an elite institution), which is relatively modern in terms of supporting mobile devices. The school is proud of its WiFi coverage in every classroom, and recently rooms were updated to have electrical outlets at every student's seat (even in auditoriums), so they can charge their devices. All courses are three-hour periods, once a week.</p>

<p>This mobile-friendly environment is great when integrating mobile technologies in class. I make use of <a href=""https://www.mentimeter.com/"">Mentimeter</a> (real-time quizzes), the students can follow the PDF lecture notes and/or electronic copies of texts, take notes on their laptops, look things up on the web when I ask questions or when they do exercises, etc. </p>

<p>However, it makes for a challenge during courses when students use these devices in distracting ways. Definitions of ""misuse"" are situational, but for this question, I'll call it any use that detracts from a healthy learning environment. Concrete examples include watching a video or playing a game on a laptop (distracting neighboring students), texting, using Facebook rather than working an exercise in group, etc.</p>

<p>Laptops and smart phones in class are not new; in the past I was able to deal with their ""misuse"" relatively easily. A student would be easily embarrassed and close his laptop if you called him out when you saw that 5 students around him were all looking at his screen and smiling. I ask a lot of questions during my classes, so I could ""pick on"" students who caused disruptions with their mobile device (or otherwise). Drawing attention to one student in large groups is an effective way to change behavior, usually.</p>

<p>However, last semester was more difficult than ever, with 40+ students in an newly-electrified auditorium. During one class interruptions occurred 3 times, and I had to talk to offending students during the break about it. During the mid-term, I had one student argue with me at the start because he wanted to keep charging his iPhone at his desk in front of him. He insisted he wasn't going to use it during the exam to cheat, but I cited the policy barring mobile devices during exams and mentioned he'd have to explain that to a discipline committee - he complied. Needless to say, those ""correctional"" situations don't win points for the professor in the course evaluation. On the other hand, I learned that if I don't intervene (early in my career I would ignore these behaviors), students who feel distracted will complain during evaluations (most are too shy to say something during the semester).</p>

<p>The solution it seems is to add yet another item in my already lengthy syllabus and explain the desired behavior during the first lecture. My school has no official policy as far as I know regarding mobile device use, apart from an IT security policy that doesn't address the distraction issues. I did some searching on the web and found that some schools have policies, e.g. <a href=""https://secureweb.mcgill.ca/secretariat/sites/mcgill.ca.secretariat/files/Mobile-Computing-Commun-devices-MC2-guidelines-11June2010.pdf"">McGill</a>. What is not clear is how effective the policies are in large classrooms, how easy they are to enforce without becoming the ""text police"", how well they work in non-elite universities, etc. </p>

<p>I contrast all this with the fact that my students almost never misuse the ""phone"" part of their devices (they don't ring during lectures and they don't talk on them except at the breaks). None of that is in my course plan and I never have to explain it at the start of the semester or take action. </p>

<p>So, how to reduce misuse of mobile devices in large classes while maintaining a friendly atmosphere?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> see this <a href=""http://www.academia.edu/870812/_I_Get_Distracted_By_Their_Being_Distracted_The_Etiquette_of_In-Class_Texting"">article</a> for the students' perspective of the problem, and why it's not like other classic forms of distraction. In the conclusion, they state it could be useful for institutions to define policies about proper behavior in the classroom regarding mobile devices.

The original authors and I do not use the same software, and theirs is proprietary (I don't have access to it). I have tried to reproduce their results, and it works qualitatively but not quantitatively: the differences between their results and mine on typical quantities of interest are between 2 and 5 times the expected accuracy of the method.</p>

<p>So far, I have communicated with the original authors, trying to clear out all possible sources of error I could think of (checked that I got the tricky parts of the algorithms right, checked that the “usual” parameters that were missing from their paper had the “usual” values, everything I could think of). They are forthcoming enough, and reply to my questions quickly, but it's clear they don't want to invest time in doing any serious follow-up on their side. And without access to their software, it appears I'm stuck.</p>

This advances the field, and is probably publishable (not in a very high-profile journal). Here, this is not possible.</p>

<p><strong>I have, however, nice results that I have obtained (extending their work far beyond what was already published), and if I didn't have these differences with their paper, it would make a very attractive paper. What can I do with those?</strong> Is it possible to publish them, merely noting the different with their paper without more comment? Or are my results simply unpublishable? I welcome any comment, especially from people who have found themselves in such an uncomfortable situation!</p>

However, I'm just as certain that my PhD research is a dead end. (My advisor doesn't think so, but I disagree with him.) Thus, I seek to change the direction of my research, but I need a few months to obtain the necessary skills. Anyway, I missed the main application period for post-doc positions (in the US).</p>

<p><strong>Given the following options (feel free to expand this list), which do you think provides the best perspective of leading me to a interesting post-doc position?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Finish my PhD. Get any post-doc position. Do the work I'm required to do there. Work hard in my spare time to teach myself the stuff I want to. After 1-2 years, find a post-doc position I'm really interested in.</li>
<li>Finish my PhD. Get a well-paying job in the software industry. Do the work I'm required to do there. Work hard in my spare time to teach myself the stuff I want to. Work harder to keep publishing papers. After one year, find a post-doc position I'm really interested in.</li>
<li>Abort my current work. Find a new subject and a new PhD advisor.</li>
<li>Live on unemployment money as long as possible. Work hard in my spare time to teach myself the stuff I want to. Work harder to keep publishing papers. After one year, find a post-doc position I'm really interested in.</li>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get the PhD title sooner. Stay in the scientific community.</li>
<li>Get the PhD title sooner. Earn lots of money (6 figure). In a 9-to-5 job, have more spare time for private research than on a post-doc position, where work is never finished. Go to a foreign country.</li>
<li>It's what I should've done 2 years ago. I'll have the education I want when I finish my PhD, not later (but be older anyway).</li>
<li>No immediate advantages over the other options.</li>
</ol>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ol>
<li>If a logical continuation of my PhD work, I'll suffer from demotivation. My next advisor will not want me to work on other topics that I'm not paid for. Might have to stay for 2 years.</li>
<li>I'll move out of the scientific community for some time. I know it's hard to get back in.</li>
<li>I'll be even older when I finally get my PhD. Not sure if I would find another advisor. Open fight with my current advisor.</li>
<li>I don't want to live on unemployment money for long.</li>

<p>The next application period will be from October to December 2013, which isn't far away. I'm sure I'll have most of the skills I want by then (and a paper published proving that), but still would have to work until summer 2014 wherever I am applying now.</p>

<p><em><strong>Are there any guidelines, sources, or examples of good practices for maintaining theorist's research notebook?</em></strong></p>

<h2>Motivation and context:</h2>

<p>Maintaining a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_notebook"">lab notebook</a> is a much advised (if not a vital) tool for doing research. Many do that nowadays also in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_lab_notebook"">electronic form</a>. While the methods for writing and maintaining a labbook might differ in details, in ""dirty-hands"" (no offense!) experimental, or field disciplines, the basics are relatively straightforward and clear. The advice tends to boil down to keep a labbook per single topic one works on and then record all the experiments and thoughts related to those experiments into the notebook. Simplifying a lot, in the end, the researcher (team) would compile a paper from the notes in the notebook.</p>

<p>Now situation of a researcher in a more theoretical discipline is strikingly different. Usually one engages in research on several topics at the same time. The problems a researcher works on are often intertwined and one's view on them changes over time, often merging originally separate streams of thought into a single one, or vice-versa. The work revolves not around experiments which would have a clear objective, but rather around currently prepared papers and then ""a cloud of ideas"". In summary, theorist's workstyle tends to be very non-linear. Maintaining some kind of a notebook is still a good thing, if for nothing else, then for not forgetting about stuff. My question is about how to go about doing it.</p>

<p>I am after a practical tool helping me to <em>archive</em> my thought process for <em>long-term</em>, as well as efficiently <em>manage</em> and <em>keep an overview</em> of the evolution of the several interacting topics I engage in.</p>

<p>I was ignorant as an undergraduate and didn't focus heavily in any specific area. I finally graduated with a single math/computer science degree that consisted of 5 math classes beyond multivariable calculus and a few relatively basic computer science classes (algorithm analysis, SQL database design, etc.). My only research experience is in economics. </p>

<p>Now, I work at a research institution in economics where I primarily write Stata/MATLAB code. </p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<p>I'd like to get more mathematics under my belt over the next few years in order to either enroll in a PhD program in economics/finance or a M.S. program in finance. What are my options for getting more math experience that I can use in graduate school admissions?</p>

<h3>Options</h3>

<p>These are the options I thought of so far, but I would like to know more if possible. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Study enough courses through a system like Open CourseWare to gain enough experience to enroll in more advanced undergraduate classes part time, which my employer might pay for, and then ideally move into an M.S. program in applied math. </p></li>
<li><p>Return to my alma mater for a M.S. degree in math that would at least give me a basis to either move into another math graduate program with higher rankings or a lower-ranked graduate program in the fields of my choice.</p></li>
<li><p>Join the Air Force and hopefully take advantage of the GI bill to take more courses somewhere and gain entrance into an M.S. program in applied math. </p></li>
<li><p>(Sadly) Forgo advanced mathematics and find a consulting job, which although unpleasant in the field of economics (in my opinion), wouldn't be difficult to obtain given my research background in the field.  </p></li>

My GPA is about 3.5. A lot of people have told me that I need to raise my GPA in order to get accepted into a decent math graduate program and this is worrying me. </p>

<p>Courses that I self-studied: Undergraduate abstract algebra, real analysis (with an introduction to measure theory), first 4 chapters of Munkres' <em>Topology</em>, elementary number theory, graph theory</p>

<p>Courses that I am self studying: Hungerford's abstract algebra, algebraic topology</p>

<p>Courses that I plan to study: algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory, complex analysis.</p>

<p>I also managed to finish 2 math papers. So the question is: Where do I stand now?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

8048,"<p>I finished my MS in mathematics 5 years ago.  Over these years I have been teaching at a community college (primarily calculus 1,2,3 with analytical geometry and Ordinary Diff. Eqs).  When I was in my masters program I was having trouble narrowing my interests and decided to stop at my masters and start teaching. During this time as an instructor I have become very interested in some applied mathematics (biology in particular).  I plan to apply to several PhD programs in the near future.   With that said, I didn't keep in touch with too many people from the university I attended.  I did stay in touch with a couple of my professors (on a minimal basis) and plan to ask them for letters of recommendation.</p>

<p>My questions...</p>

<p>Would a letter of recommendation from my department chair at the community college be of any advantage (and even suffice as 1 of the 3 required)?  Or should I call a professor from 5-7 years ago that may remember the grade they gave me?  To me the latter seems very generic and I feel my department chair could say more about my dedication to mathematics and teaching.</p>

8077,"<p>I'm a first year master student currently taking courses on the second semester. For the most part I did pretty good on the first semester except that I got behind in one course which is specially demanding and hard. </p>

<p>Now I'm taking the equivalent amount of work as before plus I'm trying to finish my assignments for the other class in order to get my grade. And I'm also collaborating in a research project which I wasn't doing last semester.</p>

<p>I'm having a hard time trying to manage my time in order to accomplish everything. As I don't want to get behind in another course I try to be on top of what I'm seeing in class. However I find that this consumes a lot more time than I expected and I never accomplish the goals I set for the day.</p>

<p>As an example, if I have some class the next day I try to really understand everything we saw the previous meeting, and by the time I manage to do that (if I do), there is only about 3 hours left to do everything else. In a normal day I expend all the time doing my ""academic stuff"" and I only stop for eating and sleeping. Where the sleeping time could vary from 0 to 6 hours depending if I feel I'm getting too far behind or if I managed to finish all I wanted for that day (rare). I have to admit that I always try to get the most miniscule detail and expend a great deal of time thinking how to go from point A to point B on the text which in some sense is a pedantic attitude. However, I find that if I don't do this, then the ideas are very shaky (there are holes in my understanding) and I tend to forget those very easily, which is not good for doing exercises or taking an exam.</p>

<p>I have tried to split the day in blocks and only expend a fixed amount of time doing an specific task. However, this way I feel I go so slow that I'm not accomplishing anything. So basically what I end up doing is working nonstop in one task (which can take more than one day) and then try to compensate for the other tasks I didn't do by cutting sleeping time or further delaying other work.</p>

<p>I sometimes think that if I'm working that hard at this level, I have no chance of getting a PhD or continuing in academia. I see that some of my peers have time to have fun, go out and still get good grades while I barely have time to enjoy a meal. I also get good grades (I have to in order to keep my scholarship) but I feel that the effort I'm putting is too much for the reward (not exceptionally good grades).</p>

8083,"<p>I recently finished my MSc in Physics and my average is within the absolute 1% of the whole institute where I study. I really like programming and numerical work, so my thesis was also concerned a lot with this, but there was also some experimental work to ""justify"" the numerical results. </p>

<p>I want to continue with a PhD and my thesis-advisor offered me a PhD project. However, the project is mostly experimental and the amount of programming is quite limited. The project is still interesting, because a large part of it is realizing the setup I proposed and simulated in my MSc thesis. It should be noted that the project is partly funded by a relatively large space agency, so (besides looking good on my CV) there are good chances of getting new contacts through this specific project. I thought that I could use this opportunity to see if it possible to spend 1-2 (or more) months at this agency during my PhD, working with them on their programming-heavy work. This wouldn't be directly related to my PhD project, so I'm not sure I'm ""allowed"" to do this, but this should be an option for me to investigate further.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I should accept this experimental PhD project, because I worried that doing too much experimental physics may not be where my interest lies. On the other hand, I don't have any other offer and it may very well take some time before I find an alternative.</p>

<hr>

<p>Regarding my future, then I definately see myself having a job which is based on programming/numerical work. This is another motivation for finding an alternative project, but would an experimental PhD make me less ""attractive"" for such a job?</p>

8085,"<p>I will try to describe my situation briefly.
The university I'm currently studying at offers a 4-year Bachelor program in mathematics.</p>

<p>I am currently in my 3rd year and the program for the 4th year consists only of optional courses (which I choose). As I have taken a rather high amount of optional courses so far, I can satisfy my ECTS requirements for the whole program in 3 years. The university, in this situation, would allow me to graduate at the end of my third year. Then, I could pursue an MSc. degree at the same university for a year and graduate with an MSc at the end of my 4th year of study in the university.</p>

<p>I would like to note that this has been done before by other students here and I'm not fantasizing.</p>

<p>My intention is to apply for a PhD at a university in the USA after the 4th year. (I am not a US citizen and I haven't studied there).</p>

<p>My question is: would getting an earlier BSc and MSc degree affect (negatively or positively) my chances for admission in a top university in the USA?
Should I just graduate with a BSc. in math?
I know that sometimes having a MSc. from the same university can be a negative sign. Should I be worried about that?</p>

<p>Some other background:
My current university is not really ""elite"" of any sort; it barely enters the top 600 in the world. I have a few published articles and I have participated in conferences. I am also currently pursuing an internship in a research institute in the country.</p>

However, my adviser made it clear during my research that it was my project and my responsibility and not his. It was clear that he was happy to mark my dissertation but didn't want to be bothered by actually helping me to learn much about research.</p>

<p>In the end, I did the research on my own and got distinction on the paper, which I was happy about. However, now I'm thinking more and more about pursuing a PhD, perhaps in intercultural management, and I feel like a highly respectable school would not consider me because I do not have much research experience.</p>

8200,"<p>I've noticed that while there's no alternative to going through the actual paper in detail, it often helps if I've gone through the presentation based on the paper, which the authors had used while publishing their papers. (Mostly because, the few presentations on TCS papers that I've seen have good geometric examples/illustrations which may have been instrumental in getting the intuition in the first place, but the brevity required by CS conferences mean very few of them make it to the published paper!)</p>

<p>While a few authors graciously maintain the links of such slides on their web-pages, most do not - and I haven't even seen a single CS conference maintaining such documents on their web-page!</p>

<p>So, I've the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Since I'm ultimately interested in understanding their work (and extending it if possible), is it considered OK to email the authors for the slides (if they still have it)? </li>
<li>If it is, do I have to justify/explain why I want the slides, or would just a polite request do (with minimal explanations on my part to keep the mail short!)? </li>
<li>Would making such a request more than once make the author feel offended, and/or make them think that someone who can't read papers at the highest level without ""assistance"" isn't exactly someone worth helping out?</li>
<li>If there are 2 authors listed, without any implications about who is the corresponding author, should I mail both of them at the same time (which may lead to both of thinking the other would be responding), or separately (which may lead to duplication of efforts!)?</li>

8214,"<p>I don't know how to start, truly, but lately I've been involved with some projects in pure mathematics and I've grown frustrated and disappointed. I don't think that pure mathematics is so inspiring; my intent is to move on to study some applied math but most teachers in my department aren't that dedicated to it. All I see are theoretical approaches to problems ""that applied sciences may be interested some day"".</p>

<p>By talking to a colleague of mine who is seriously considering moving on from Math to Physics, he told me of some engineering departments who might accept someone with a master's degree in their Phd programs. There are some areas I like that might have a connection with what is studied in some Engineering Phd programs, like applied ODE and Dynamical systems and I'd love to put some programming on what I do.</p>

<p>But every teacher I talked about this so far tells me to avoid this kind of migration, since it brings a loss of academic focus and it might be hard for me to find a job later as a teacher. There is no strong tradition in Mathematical Engineering as there is in other countries (I know that such courses exists in Italy and some other European contries).</p>

8221,"<p>I have worked in a few high profile research institutes for my PhD and postdoc, and find myself a little intimidated by the ""strong opinions"" and arguments that seem to crop up at the principal investigator level.  My personality is somewhat more laid back or agreeable, and I find myself wondering if this would be seen as a ""personality flaw"" in the somewhat cutthroat funding and scientific world (or at least that part I am exposed to).  I'm sure it helps to have a strong opinion of one's own work, but I sometimes find it hard to do so, as I tend to be more self-critical and more concerned about stating something correctly and figuring out what is ""right"" than necessarily being self-promoting and overconfident in my own abilities, but I feel like that ends up manifesting as some sort of fundamental flaw in relation to others I see advancing into the faculty ranks.</p>

8223,"<p>When meeting some scientists in person, I've had good conversations with decisions upon interesting plans for research cooperation and personal visits. But then, subsequent contact by e-mail is difficult, where the other party either doesn't reply at all, or very slowly (several weeks +). However, when I then meet them again at a later date, they are still enthusiastic about the project (where the bulk of the work is mine) and a short in-person discussion makes more progress than the past months of (lack of) e-mail have. So it appears that a lack of interest in the project does not explain the lack of response. The project is scientifically interesting, fits with my PhD, and the visit enhances my chances of finding a post-doc after my PhD (it's a very good institute for my field).</p>

<p>I understand that many scientists are very busy and flooded by e-mail, but it feels sad to abandon a potentially interesting project just because communication by e-mail is not working well. I'm quite sure it would work if I were in the same building. What strategies exist to mitigate this problem? I can think of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Try to ask a common acquaintance to poke him/her (my local colleague has a shared friend with him/her). Pro: Might get indirect feedback as to why the irresponsiveness. Con: involves 3rd party (may or may not be on-site) not necessarily involved.</li>
<li>Send reminder e-mails (<em>did you see my e-mail from 20 February?</em>). Pro: increases chances of being noticed. Con: may be considered annoying</li>
<li>Phone. Pro: hard to run away. Con: I don't like phoning and I don't like being phoned.</li>
<li>E-mail someone sitting in the neighbouring office. Pro: neighbour has small step to irresponsive scientist. Con: a bit strange to involve someone I don't even know</li>
<li>Give up on the project. Con: means no project and no visit.</li>
<li>Try to do the project without their input. Pro: no need for communication. Con: might waste a lot of time by trying known dead-ends that I'm not aware of. </li>

8297,"<p>First some background. Two years ago I joined a research group as a research associate. My intention in obtaining that position was to publish with the group and build some academic capital, but in the two years I have been there, I have been steered toward support work and software development, and away from research.  I have not been included in any of the group's publications and have had to publish unrelated work on my own. </p>

<p>I subsequently found out that to justify the Ph.D. requirement for the position I hold, my employers added a few sentences to the job description to suggest that research would be the central focus of the work. Within my group I am seen as a system administrator and IT guy. This is apparently what my employers really wanted.</p>

<p>I’m also acutely aware that I lack the superior eloquence of my more persuasive colleagues. (This inability would hamper me not only in academia but in virtually any career.) My superiors cannot be persuaded that the system I have been assigned to create, intended to demonstrate (nonexistent) technical capabilities to a skeptical funding agency, has already been executed by several competent, experienced and well-funded teams of more than one person. The project is an all-consuming, deeply anxiety inducing death march for which I am underqualified. Against this, I have at least three competing projects which cannot receive the exclusive, full-time attention each deserves, and I am continually interrupted with trivial software installation requests and technical failures rare enough not to have been documented in the ever-expanding global online archive of technical minutia, to which StackExchange is a prominent contributor. The perspective is that information technology hasn’t specialized in the past 30 years–nothing is too trivial to undertake (except for them) or too specialized and technical to require immersion and consistent practice. It is the menial and urgent work of cleaning digital bedpans.</p>

<p>I don’t have a family or children–I did not want them. I wanted to work in an environment where I could be paid for research. The compensation is $24K less than the administrative position I previously held. I feel that it is self-defeating for me to continue supporting professors, postdocs, and postgraduate and undergraduate students. There is little incentive to promote an individual assigned to projects that provide funding for the group, and to activities that support the research efforts of others, but which are unlikely themselves to result in publication. </p>

<p>But since my work as a mental technician is valued, I'm wondering whether I might as well seek better compensated employment outside of academia, where I would not have the indignity of supporting persons whose career opportunities are foreclosed to me.</p>

I am presently applying for postdoctoral positions (in both Mathematics and Quantitative Physics departments). However, I am not getting any reply from most of the places and got a few rejection letters as well. Since I am from Mathematics, I cannot apply to experimental groups (where there are more openings).

8519,"<p>I had an amazing time at my REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) last summer.  I would really love to do another one this year.</p>

<p>Problem is, I am about to graduate, so I will technically not be an undergraduate this summer.  I do intend to continue my education in graduate school in the Fall, and have been admitted somewhere.</p>

<p>I've been told that I should just kick back and relax this summer so that I'm fully unwound for grad school, but I don't have any money to travel, all my friends will have left for their grad school already, and there's really nothing that would stress me out more than sitting around and doing nothing for three months.  I love to travel, make new friends, and learn cool stuff, so I think doing another REU would actually be the perfect way for me to unwind.</p>

<p>At my last REU, we had a student who had graduated that year and was about to go into a Master's program.  It was rumored that she had omitted/lied about this on her application and the admissions people just didn't look into it carefully.  I don't know if this is true, though.  It seems possible that the program staff simply felt her application was strong enough to warrant making an exception - after all, she wasn't <em>going</em> to grad school yet.</p>

  <p>Is it possible to be admitted to a mathematics REU the summer between undergrad and graduate school?</p>

8542,"<p>I'm finishing a PhD in Sweden this year and seeking a post-doc in the United States (atmospheric remote sensing).  It is clear that a job in academia is not a <em>nine to five job</em>; nor do I want it to be.  I often work late in the evening when I'm on a productive spur.  When an important dead-line is coming up, one needs to work harder, and there is no overtime paid.  I accept that.  However, no matter how much I'm interested in my research, I do enjoy and need a reasonable amount of spare time, too; relaxing on the weekends, occasionally a long weekend away, and sometimes a longer trip, such as three weeks in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Regarding the normal work ethos for early-career academics in the United States, I have a hard time judging what is normal and what is excessive.  Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/"">Erick Carreira letter</a> warning post-docs that he <em>expects all of the members of the group to work evenings and weekends</em>.</li>
<li>My apparent naïveté in believing that <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/8427/how-to-arrange-sabbatical-leave#comment14691_8427"">a sabbatical means not working</a>, despite Wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatical"">describing it</a> as <em>a rest from work, or a hiatus, often lasting from two months to a year</em>.  I was thinking of my friend, who spent a year between his PhD and his first post-doc travelling from France to Mongolia mostly on foot.</li>
<li>Someone <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/1816/do-interviews-require-taking-vacation-days/1817#comment2888_1817"">commenting</a> <em>I am not a good role model, but when I don't work on a Sunday, I count that as a vacation day</em>.</li>
<li><a href=""http://nasa.orau.org/postdoc/description/faq.htm"">NASA postdocs</a> having <em>no employment-related benefits such as paid vacations, sick leave, or unemployment compensation</em>.</li>
<li>Question <em><a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/q/5005/1033"">How do we end the culture of “endless hours at work”?</a></em></li>
</ul>

<p>We don't have such a work-ethos where I'm at.  I belief that working too hard risks stress and burn-out, and does not increase productivity in the long run, nor human well-being.  I want to do science.  Doing science makes me happy, but having time to relax while not doing science is important for me.</p>

<p>Does the selection of examples I gave above represent a normal situation in U.S. early-career academia?  Should I expect an attitude where asking for a 3-week holiday during the summer is considered as being not serious, or is the situation in practice usually not as bad as the examples above make it sound?  How hard to early-career academics in the United States work, really?</p>

8574,"<p>I have submitted a paper several years ago and its referee process took about three years and I had to revise the paper six times to get the final approval. The paper had two helpful and knowledgable referees and I appreciate their comments and suggestions, but I have also had the following problems with their suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li>sometimes their comments contradicted each other. For example, one of them wanted me to add a discussion and when I added that part he wanted me to remove it in the next revision. </li>
<li>they often wanted to expand the scope of the paper, but due to some technicalities I had to consider some restrictions to get the expected result.</li>
<li>they gave me new comments and proposed new modifications after every single revision, while they could suggest all their comments in their first report and this made the referee process this long. </li>
<li>one of the referees wanted me to address some related works in other papers in my paper, which was actually unnecessary.</li>
</ol>

<p>I pretty much obeyed all their suggestions and comments and finally the paper was accepted and now it has been published.

I had to do whatever they asked me even if I was not completely convinced it is a right thing to do. I have also had some of the abovementioned problems with the referees of my other papers.

8586,"<p>To explain, let me pick a particular statement: ""the electrostatic force is mediated by the exchange of photons"".</p>

<p>When a physicist (or a lecturer) says this, they mean one thing: the process described in detail by QED. When a student (or an amateur) hears this, they think of two electrons, and they imagine photons flying between them. You can imagine what follows: questions like <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/197/how-are-forces-mediated"">""how do they know where to fly""</a>, or <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/19015/what-frequency-photons-are-involved-in-mediating-physical-force"">""what is the frequency of these photons""</a>, or ""where does the energy to create those photons come from"" etc.</p>

<p>When I was growing up, I had no access to anyone who really understood physics. All I had were books filled to the brim with phrases like the above.

<p>What is the most effective way to educate students about such phenomena, where our language we use to describe them risks obscuring the reality, and/or misleading the students? Is there evidence in the pedagogic literature on this?</p>

I am a finishing Ph.D. student in Mathematics at a decent school in the US, and my postdoctoral job applications so far have gone in vein, although I do have published paper in recognized journal. Also, I had to switch my advisor and subject in the middle of my Ph.D., so I think I would have been better off with more experience in the field I am working on or a related field.

<p>Say University U in Europe has a postdoc position P for salary x for 2 years, and Ph.D. position D for salary y for 4 years, where x>y. If I can get P, great, but if not, can I also talk to and try to come to an agreement with the university (e-mail them with explanation etc.) for a visiting position where I will be learning some more stuffs and will be researching as well, but may be with less salary than P but the same (or little more) salary as/than D? In other words, I feel like I need to gain more knowledge in my area, so if I don't get P, I will be happy with almost the same salary y as D, but will try to bend the rule from 4 years to just 1 year? So it will be like a visiting position with less salary, of less time period, but I will like to be treated like a Ph.D. student (that means less independent research, more learning compared to a postdoc). Will that be a ridiculous thing to try? So, I will be somewhat like an advanced Ph.D. student but not expert like a postdoc and so I am willing to negotiate with the salary, I won't need another Ph.D. since I will have had one(if they give another, fantastic!)

<p>So in order to get into a decent PhD program (I will have to change fields from Communications to Education since there are no PhD programs in my field in proximity to my tuition reimbursing institution), should I focus on pumping up my GRE score, or getting some publishing under my belt? While the second sounds like a lot more fun, I wonder if a good set of publications would matter if my GRE is abysmal? </p>

8829,"<p>My engineering university offers a relatively new option to do an article-based dissertation, where the primary research is submitted (and hopefully published) in several scientific journals (at my university it's 3). The dissertation is then shorter than a typical PhD, because it describes how the articles fit together to form the thesis, etc. </p>

<p>It's a relatively new idea (for engineering PhDs and for me), which I find interesting as an advisor because it engages PhD students more in the research experience (publishing). Also, it is theoretically more efficient for the advisor and student (as a co-author), since time and energy spent on revising could be more focused on getting publications, and not only on a big PhD dissertation that few people will ever read. </p>

<p>There are other advantages described <a href=""http://www2.ul.ie/pdf/324176726.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> (not my university).</p>

<p>My question is not about whether it's good or bad, but how the role of an advisor on co-authored papers might change in such cases. </p>

<p>For example, when students write a traditional dissertation (masters or otherwise), they often struggle with communicating. Students grow and improve written communication and contents of the dissertation in an iterative and incremental process (draft revisions after feedback from the advisor). </p>

<p>In traditional grad-student co-authorship setting, I would take a more active role as an editor (as my advisor did when I was a PhD student) on a paper, mostly because of experience and to increase chances of getting an article published. Sometimes that role is minimal, if only a workshop or conference is targeted, since it might be easier to publish there.</p>

<p>But with an article-based PhD, it seems that the active approach in editing co-authored journal papers is essential, and in effect <em>writing a big part of the dissertation</em> for the student. I realize every case is different.</p>

<p>I'd be happy to know from experienced advisors in this setting to know if and how an advisor's role must change in article-based PhDs.</p>

<p>My question is, can I put the code in the public domain, if I decide to do so. And can I run the code for other people in exchange of co-authorship for their papers?</p>

<p>Anyway, in my second year on the tenure track, I find myself more confined to my corner of the ivory tower than I intended to be, and would like to branch out and meet other faculty in other areas. </p>

<p>My research (in theoretical math) is very specialized, so I don't have collaborations in mind. Also I would rather not volunteer for university-wide committees, as these look rather boring and I don't find myself inspired by the administration's pet projects.</p>

<p>Rather, I have in mind something intellectual and <em>fun</em>, that recaptures some of the enjoyment of being an undergraduate and hopefully leading to making new friends. For example, semi-public lectures on chemistry, theology, art history, virtually anything intellectual, ideally followed by discussions and debates over beer... </p>

<p>Obviously, the first step is to do a better job of carefully looking for opportunities at my particular university. (These have been a bit hard to suss out, but I could stand to look harder). Nevertheless I would be interested to hear success stories. What have people done to make connections outside their own field of interest?</p>

8930,"<p>My problem is the following: I teach  an honors course in an engineering discipline at a small university. (It is not exactly that, but ""teaching an honors course"" is a good approximation to what I do). Large US companies sometimes ask me to recommend the best students for an interview, and they are often hired. The policy of the University in general is that it doesn't discriminate on political opinions or religious beliefs or anything of that sort. </p>

<p>Now, I have a student who is a very nice person and has a great academic record but he supports an ideology that many would find abhorrent. (Again, this doesn't mean he is a bad person. For example, the famous mathematician and Fields Medalist Stephen Smale supported Stalinist communism in his youth, in reaction to unjust practices in the US:
<a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/200011/rev-kirby.pdf"">http://www.ams.org/notices/200011/rev-kirby.pdf</a>   ). </p>

<p>Now, if I recommend him, I think there's a reasonable chance he gets hired because he's pretty good in technical matters. But then I think he might really get into problems there because he supports his ""bad"" ideology in a rather ostentatious manner, and I'm afraid that this will reflect badly on me and on my ability to recommend other students. I'm pretty sure the overwhelming majority of employees would be hostile to his ideology.</p>

<p>Mind you, I wouldn't have hesitated for a second to give him a recommendation for graduate study, people are usually much more understanding of that sort of stuff in academia, and the only person he really would have to please in that case is his advisor, and if the student's research is good, the advisor would probably forget about all the rest. But working in the industry necessitates interaction with a lot of people, and I think his ideological views may cause problems.</p>

8959,"<p>I'm a graduate student with, so far, one published article in a peer-reviewed journal.  Since the article came out, I've been receiving increasing amounts of ""academic e-mail spam"" from people wanting me to attend their conferences, publish in their (usually pay-to-publish) journals or order research supplies from them.  <sub><sup>(The latter kind tend to be the easiest to filter out &mdash; even though my field is <i>bio</i>mathematics, it doesn't mean I have any use for frozen mouse embryos whatsoever.)</sup></sub></p>

<p>Some time ago, an e-mail turned up asking me to review a manuscript, conveniently attached to the message, for a pay-to-publish open access journal in a somewhat related field.  Googling for the name of the publisher, I found them described as e.g. ""a borderline vanity press"".</p>

<p>At the time, I wasn't really sure how to react.  On one hand, I could think of several reasons to just go ahead and review the manuscript:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The main complaint about the publisher seems to be that their peer review is insufficient &mdash; a claim supported by the fact that they seem to be picking random grad students as reviewers.  Still, given that they're at least making <em>some</em> effort at peer review, surely I should encourage them in that?  After all, if nobody agreed to review manuscripts for them, how could they ever improve their review process?</p></li>
<li><p>Declining to review the manuscript might deprive the authors &mdash; who, if the journal is indeed a ""scam"", are presumably the victims here &mdash; of useful feedback.  Surely they at least deserve that much return for their time, efforts and money?</p></li>
<li><p>Also, if the manuscript did get published in a scientific journal, no matter how dubious or marginal, it would enter the body of scientific knowledge, and might be used as a reference by others.  Given that, surely it is my duty as a scientist to try, given the opportunity, to do what I can to ensure that it is at least correct?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Still, despite these arguments, I initially found the idea of willingly <em>responding to spam</em> to be deeply unsettling at a fundamental, almost visceral level.  Also, I felt concerned that, by doing volunteer work for a possibly unethical publisher, I'd be supporting their business model and perhaps lending them an undeserved appearance of legitimacy.
In particular, given that the subject of the manuscript wasn't <em>that</em> close to my own field, I worried that it might have errors that I would not be capable of spotting, and that, even if I made this clear in my review, the publisher might still use the review to support the publication of a possibly flawed article.</p>

<p>(Edit: Just to be clear, I wasn't worried that they'd reveal the names of reviewers, just that, even if I was the <em>only</em> one who sent back a review, they might still use it to claim that ""yes, the paper was peer reviewed."")</p>

<p>In the end, the decision was actually rather easy: after a cursory glance at the manuscript, it became clear that there was <em>no way</em> I could support its publication as written, especially given that large fragments of it were clearly plagiarized, and I wrote back to the journal stating as much.</p>

<p>However, if I ever receive a similar request again (and I assume I probably will, sooner or later), what do you think I should do with it?</p>

8967,"<p>I'm writing a proposal to acquire funding for a competition to be hosted at my university.  The competitors are restricted to graduate students who are engaged in <em>research</em> under the auspicies of a faculty advisor from my university.

<p>At first, I equated <em>research</em> with <em>publishable</em> in a peer reviewed journal, but I soon realized that the terms <em>publishable</em> and <em>peer reviewed</em> would have to be defined...

<p>I know it's a good idea to provide 'consultation time' for students as one-on-one teaching helps the student in so many ways. However, in a shared office it seems that some of the benefits of one-on-one teaching disappear. For example, the student is less likely to be concerned about how they look in front of others if it's in a private office but if there are other teachers (perhaps with other students) then your student will have those issues again.</p>

<p>I worked under another professor the next winter, published an article in a highly reputed journal in the field of Complex networks and working on another publication this fall. I'll be working along with IBM in a research internship this summer and hoping to do well. A bit of a late realization haunts me day-to-day. Needless to say, my transcripts suck. So, to dodge all the obstacles that I created myself, I'm planning to do research work extensively for the rest of my Undergrad time.

The second being not so important.</p>

She is just a bright student, not a genius, with a bit of research experience in cryptography and randomness stuff, and a semifinalist in a couple of national competitions.   She intends to continue graduate study in theoretical CS, or a closely related subfield, after finishing her undergraduate degree.</p>

9127,"<p>I have been working as a entry-level web developer for approximately a year now.  I am looking to go back to school to get a Master's Degree in hopes that I will be able to teach programming/development at the community college level (which requires a Master's Degree).  I'm not interested in a PhD because I have to work full-time to support my family and I'm not interested in doing research.  I have narrowed down my options to 2 programs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Brandeis University has a Master's in Software Engineering, which teaches a lot of very specific, high-level courses (primarily Java programming and development).</p></li>
<li><p>Boston University Master's in Computer Science - Web Development, teaches a more holistic approach that spans several domains, but doesn't go into as much detail.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Do you find that a particular academic background makes one more marketable for teaching at the community college level?  I feel that having a deep mastery of a specific technology is great, but community college courses generally do not get that deep into the material.  I'm also a little nervous that if I take a more general curriculum that introduces me to many topics, my transcripts may not show that I have a deep enough understanding of a specific subject to teach at the college level.</p>

<p><em>When I have a choice to take only one of two possible sequences: A theoretical one which aids my research and an applied one that aids my employability, which one should I opt for? (I must do the other on my own)</em></p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>I am currently in a PhD program for Applied Math. I have finished all my core courses but am now required to take any (from a list) of courses which span Econ (Micro Econ, Time series type stuff), Management (Business Intelligence) and Statistics (Mathematical Stats, the gnarly stuff). My research is on Big Data Analytics from a Mathematical perspective.</p>

<p>I want to keep my options for engineering (Electrical/Industrial Engineering) and Business (Data Analytics) faculty positions open. I want to join academi and in my department, senior students have gotten jobs in all of the three quoted above.</p>

<p>From that standpoint, what courses should I be taking? My time is constrained and I have to choose one of the three. I know for my research, I will benefit from a more rigorous mathematical training in Stats but I don't know if this will help me get a business school job. If I choose one, I know I can (&amp; will probably make time) do the other two on my own but I am confused which one to pick. </p>

<p>The way I think :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If I do stats, I will have a rigorous background in any kind of statistical inference which is gold for what I do but I will have no clue about microecon, finance or business intelligence. All three are big application areas for my research.</p></li>
<li><p>If I do econ/business intelligence, for my research, I might get stuck at times when I am trying to interchange an expectation with a gradient and wondering ""under what conditions can I do this"". </p></li>

However, I only want him to write me a recommendation if he is going to write a <em>good</em> one. If he will write me a mediocre or just insufficiently positive recommendation, I would prefer to have someone less famous than X but more positive about me write the letter.</p>

<p>If I simply ask Prof. X for a letter, there is the possibility that he will agree and  then  write something that is not as positive as I would like. I want to avoid this. </p>

<p>One way to solve this problem would be for me to ask Prof. X if he is sufficiently familiar with my work to write me a strong letter. If he does not wish to write me a strong letter, he can simply reply that he is not that familiar with the whole body of my work. By giving him an easy way to decline, this makes it more likely that he will write a strong letter if he accepts.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in this case this little strategem will not work, as Prof. X and I have been working on the same questions for years, so there is little question of him being unfamiliar with my results. </p>

<p>A. Mention to Prof. X that I'm going on the job market in unrelated conversation and see if he volunteers to write me a letter. </p>

<p>B. Ask him for a letter in an email and see how he responds. If he responds enthusiastically, e.g., ""It would be my pleasure to write you a letter..."" or ""I'd be extremely happy to..."" this is good. If he only responds neutrally, e.g., ""Sure, I can write you a letter"" then simply neglect to follow up with him and ask someone else for the letter. </p>

<p>Both of these strategies are decent, but they are not perfect. They might work, but they also might cause me to miss out on a good letter from a well-known scholar. Anyway, I'd welcome thoughts, corrections, additional strategies to use that I haven't thought of, etc. </p>

<p>Since I assume it does not reflect the ethnicity of the local environment (Washington DC), I went to search for an explanation. Wikipedia says it's a “historically black university”](<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>established before 1964 with the intention of serving the black community</p>

<p>So, I understand that segregation-era black universities might have a predominantly African American faculty and student body after the end of segregation, but it's now almost 50 years ago. So, <strong>what factors explain how an institution such as Howard University didn't get more ethnically/racially diverse, while multiculturalism seems an important part of academic way of life?</strong></p>

9446,"<p>There are some journals, such as <a href=""http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=BBS"">Behavioral and Brain Sciences</a>, that publish a single target article per issue, followed by 20 to 30 commentaries on that article, and then a rebuttal/synthesis from the target article authors. Their rough workflow seems to be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Authors submit a target article.</li>
<li>Target article is peer-reviewed as in a normal journal, with a focus on if it is of sufficient interest to warrant discussion in such a forum setting.</li>
<li>If accepted, the editors send a massive number of invitations to associates of the journal, soliciting commentary proposals on the target article. A dark-net link to the final version of the target article is included.</li>
<li>Authors submit commentary proposals, and the editors review them, selecting a subset that would make a good discussion.</li>
<li>Selected commentators write their articles and submit them to the editors</li>
<li>Editors do a quick review of commentaries and pass them on to the target article authors for a rebuttal.</li>
<li>Target article authors write a rebuttal.</li>
<li>Everything is published at the same time (this is the stage that BBS makes anything directly publicly available from their site).</li>
</ol>

<p>At stage [3], the number of commentators contacted is significantly in excess of what you would for soliciting peer review. A link to the post-review paper that is accessible without any logins is also distributed, but this link is on the 'dark net' -- nothing on the main site links directly to it. The contacted associates are encouraged to share the article with their colleagues and bring non-contacted collaborators on board if they want to write a commentary. </p>

<p>My question is: <strong>to what extent can the sharing in step [3] be taken?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Can you share the article privately as much as you want? I.e. can a non-associate that was sent the article by an associate (but not the editor) then forward it to another non-associate?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you contact the authors of the target article with questions or comments that make it obvious that you've read the article? (Note, that you wouldn't be able to do this for an article you are peer-reviewing)</p></li>
<li><p>Can you write a blog post about the article before it comes out, making a summary of it, and referencing it as (to appear)?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you share the link that was emailed to you publicly (say on your blog)?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the target authors often have a preprint of the target article linked from their website, kind of like a white paper (although it isn't always exactly the same version as is sent out by BBS). I am interested in answers to the above questions in both cases: when a preprint is available from the authors and when only the BBS dark-net link exists.</p>

9456,"<p>I am a graduate student in the physical sciences working towards my Ph.D and planning to finish in less than two years from now. In this age, where data mining/collection/analysis and then selling/using it for profit has become ubiquitous and quite easy because of the internet and the ever increasing plethora of electronic devices, I have become a little paranoid and worked quite hard over the past decade to keep myself anonymous and to stop anyone from piecing info about me as much as possible. I do regularly google myself and see what I can learn about myself.</p>

<p>So the thing is, I don't have a webpage of any kind. No blogs! Certainly no social sites. No professional/connection profiles like on LinkedIn. Even the university provided webpage/space is unused and I try to control where my university email is published. Only the people who know me and have met me face to face (personally and professionally like at a conference) have my info to get in touch with me. It would be quite difficult for someone who I don't know to get in touch with me even if it is research related. A potential employer will have a very hard time trying to find anything about me on the internet.</p>

<p>So my question is how detrimental is this behavior to my professional future? Just how bad is it really, assuming it is bad? Do I really need it? Will this hurt my chances in the future when I try to get a postdoc or a job in the industry? I haven't published anything yet but I will very soon and then I expect to have at least another paper before I graduate. Furthermore, I really don't know what will I be doing after graduation. I might do a postdoc at a lab but then after that I don't plan on staying in academia. I might just stay at a lab or go to the industry working for a R&amp;D somewhere. I am also toying with the idea of just starting my own small business. It could be something completely unrelated to my degree like a bakery or a bookstore.</p>

<p>But let's stay that even if I decide to stay in the field like working at a national lab and publishing regularly, can this be done without a public online presence?</p>

9471,"<p>I have been wondering recently about how graduate schools and in general anyone who reviews my academic record views coops. By coop, I mean a semester taken off from undergraduate studies to work in a related industry. If the student takes more than 8 semesters to graduate, is it a problem? Should the student (if they can) extend their studies by an additional semester so that they graduate in the spring, or is a fall graduation equally acceptable. Do grad programs accept students to start in the spring, or only the fall?</p>

<p>I tried to keep the question above general pursuant to the guidelines in the FAQ, however I will appreciate anyone who is willing to review my specific case.</p>

<p>I am a sophomore in CS at a strong US engineering school. I have 2 summer internships, and now a coop under my belt. My problem is, I do not like any of the work I have experienced. I don't mind programming, but it is not something I can do for 40 hours a week without getting really bored. I only really enjoy the difficult math problems, which don't come up that often for most CS jobs,and I absolutely hate wires, soldering, network-admin and low-level computer work.</p>

<p>I want to switch to Math and pursue a graduate degree in either data science or applied math. I can graduate on time by dropping to a math major and a cs and stat double minor, or I can add a semester and get a double major in math and cs or stats, or take graduate classes. I should also mention that my GPA is currently at 3.2 largely because I have tried to alter the CS curriculum to incorporate the things that interest me (a realistic expectation is a 3.4-3.5 graduating GPA). My final consideration is that the math dept at my school is somewhat low on most academic rankings, whereas my CS dept is in the thunder-weight category trailing the likes of MIT. It would not be hard for me to find research opportunities in either department, which I intend to do either way.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.nsf.gov/"">U.S. NSF</a> distributes a very detailed (76 pages) set of guidelines (<a href=""http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpgprint.pdf"">The National Science Foundation Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide: Part I - Grant Proposal Guide, available in PDF here</a>).

<li>b. Project Summary</li>
<li>c. Table of Contents</li>
<li>d. Project Description</li>

<li>h. Current and Pending Support</li>
<li>i. Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources</li>
<li>j. Special Information and Supplementary Documentation</li>
<li>k. Appendices</li>

<p>It seems that the Project Description -- at least from the intellectual merit and broader impacts perspective -- will contain the ""meat"" of my proposal; the Project Description has a 15 page limit.

Finally, I should discuss broader impacts of the proposed work.  </p>

<p>But, beyond this, the NSF Guidelines do not seem to be all that specific about sections or section headings within the Project Description section.  <strong>Am I free to make my own sections/section headings <em>within</em> the Project Description section?</strong>  For example, could I make a section ""Previous experimental work,"" followed by a section ""Previous theoretical work,"" followed by a section ""Proposed model description,"" and so on and so on?

<p><strong>A.</strong> They said that an activity that tries to answer a question like</p>

  <p>'What are the age, sex and subject distributions of doctoral students in
  British higher education?'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is considered descriptive, intelligence-gathering activity, but not research. This is pretty clear and agreed upon. However, they attribute that to the <strong>'what'</strong> nature of the question.</p>

<p>Later, they said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Research goes beyond description and requires analysis. It looks for explanations,
  relationships, comparisons, predictions, generalizations and theories. These are the <strong>‘why’</strong> questions. Why are there so many fewer women doctoral students in physics than in biology? ...</p>
  
  <p>All these questions require good intelligence-gathering, just as decisionmaking and policy formulation do. But the information is used for the purpose of developing understanding – by comparison, by relating to other factors, by theorizing and testing the theories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it sound to consider only 'why' questions as research? How about some 'what' and 'how' questions?</p>

<p><strong>B.</strong> In the same text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>All research questions have comparisons in them</strong>, as the words ‘fewer’, ‘different’ and ‘less’ in the examples above illustrate.</p>

However, I sometimes check <a href=""http://www.wikicfp.com"">www.wikicfp.com</a> to not miss any deadline if there is one. Finally I found one, read the details about the conference and submit the paper.</p>

<p>This week I got the results. It was positive, I think this is great because I am warming up for academia. However, when I received the review (only one), I felt that this conference could be fake or bogus. They sent me a text file that has the following review (with the name and some strange gmail address as the reviewer email):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>paper quality is good different models are explained but this is not a
  result oriented paper no comparison results for different models with
  graphical point of view</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank God I had a paper rejected before. I had submitted it to a workshop on a different topic and the reviews were detailed, well explained without reviewer strange email addresses.</p>

<p>Besides the acceptance email has details more about the registration details, bank accounts, fees etc., than preparing final draft or other scientific related issues.</p>

<p>So right now I am a bit confused about what to do next or how to react. But my question is the following:
<strong>What are the good indicators of fake/bogus conferences?</strong></p>

9659,"<p>I am a new PhD student in Canada. Recently my university nominated me for the Ontario Trillium Scholarship (to my surprise), which I eventually won. I originally come from a country which do not use the system of scholarships and awards, so I do not know much about the benefits of scholarships. As I see there are three potential benefits:</p>

<ol>
<li>More money for living ($40.000 each year for four years in this case, for living and tuition)</li>
<li>The Scholarhip pays for tuition and other fees, so your supervisor/institute do not need to pay anything</li>
<li>Looks good on a CV</li>
</ol>

<p>I have not much advantage of the point 1, since my institute usually gives higher PhD salaries than standards in Canada and therefore I only receive slightly higher salary relative to that (people from other institutes will of course benefit from the extra cash). Number 2 seems to be a really good benefit of scholarships, since they make you more free and able to pursue your own interests even more (since your supervisor is not paying).</p>

<p>My question is primarily about point 3. How big a role does Scholarships play when applying for a post doc position? I generally see many people in North America, especially the US, which have a lot of scholarships and awards they have won. This is my first ever, since we do not have awards in my original country. Is there any real advantage to be able to mention previously won scholarships? And my final question is, how good is the Ontario Trillium Scholarship in this regard? Is this a standard type of scholarship?</p>

9661,"<p>I am working on a research project that all total will probably end up lasting about 2 years.  As the research progresses, I am writing articles about each new discovery/study, with each article becoming more relevant to current interesting trends (for lack of a better description).</p>

<p>What I mean by this is that in the plan for publications my group has, the first article discusses just the structure, dynamics, etc. of some new interesting carbon/silicon/etc. system.  The second article will elaborate on this for an even more novel, more developed structure than the first.  Then the last article will (hopefully) provide a deep new insight into how this structure can be used for energy storage/transport/etc.</p>

<p>As I'm sure you can tell, each article gets more interesting, and thus I think each article has a better chance than the previous one of making it into a more highly ranked journal.  Our current strategy is to submit the article to a succession of less prestigious journals (each getting rejected) until it eventually gets into one.  This way, it ends up getting into the journal it probably deserves to be in, and not something lower.  And hey, there's always the chance it is accepted into a highly ranked journal as well.</p>

<p>However, I am curious if this is a bad idea in the long run.  Will editors remember ""Oh, this guy already submitted articles to us twice and got rejected; what's he doing it for again?""  Will they be quicker to dismiss the next article they receive even though it is higher-quality/deeper research than the previous one?</p>

<p>Or do the editors give each new submission a fair chance for acceptance, with no memory of previous submissions?</p>

<p>I know some of you all are journal editors, so any insight you can reveal to me about your thought process would be quite appreciated.</p>

9718,"<p>I have a bachelor degree in Computer Engineering. I worked as a Research Engineer in a Research Center. It was a fully paid Engineering position funded by European projects.</p>

<p>However, my contract ended, and because there are not any more projects available at the moment, I can't be recontracted.</p>

<p>My question:</p>

<p>Is it possible for someone to work as a freelance researcher? I have an idea of a platform I would like to work on. The idea, I think, could easily even become a paper. Is it possible that I could continue to work in the research center without being paid, and try to perform some research of my own? Of course I could ask my supervisors about it, but the thing is, I don't know how to ask it.</p>

<p>What I was thinking was they could provide me tools like the computer, mobile devices and a working desk to develop my idea (things that I was provided while working there). In the end it would be something that the university could present, but I would get credit for it for my CV, and it could be especially helpful in getting a good candidate position next year, in a Masters program I am aiming for.</p>

<p>How could I present an idea like this to my supervisor? Is it something that actually happens? </p>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<hr>

<p>Because of low reputation i cant comment on the answers so i ll add this edit on my answer to clear things a bit. The problem is not that i need any kind of equipment to make my idea reality. At work i was provided a simple laptop and some mobile devices , that i can easily have access on my own , so nothing special there.</p>

<p>The reason why i would like to continue work there is as simple as that:</p>

<p>I want to propose an idea of a platform that i would like to create and according to my estimates would be 9-12 months of work. I could do that from my house or by going to work at the research center. <strong>However</strong> , i need my supervisor to draw public/scientific attention , make a paper with him out of it etc. I want to be able to write in my cv that the last 9-12 months i was working on a project at ""that"" research center in cooperation with ""that"" researcher and not that it was a ""home"" project that i developed.</p>

<p>I havent made the proposition to my supervisor yet for the following reasons :</p>

<p>1) I am afraid that he could simply use my idea with the engineers that still have a contract there.</p>

<p>2) What i would like is to be the only one working on the project. Like a phd thesis. I want to get credits of it. Not the research center. I want to get the credit as the main developer/author of this thing , and of course my supervisor be the one that would present it and his name next to mine. Is this even possible? I mean i dont want any other engineers sniffing their nose on it , i dont want my supervisor to demand things on the project. I am thinking of proposing to him a complete solution of exactly what i have in mind , let me work on it with my time , without any fundings , but he ll be the one to present it and draw attention on it.</p>

<p>In the end all i am saying is to have this project on my cv to open some doors on the future and my supervisor being the mentor of this thing.</p>

9769,"<p>The essential gist of my question relates to what the real, unvarnished realities are of graduate, post-graduate, research, fellowship, and professorship attainment - <em>when you aren't a single person with no pressing demands other than feeding yourself</em>. </p>

<p>[<strong>EDIT</strong>: <em>I am humbled by the incredibly helpful and thoughtful responses so far, all of which are +1 from me. I'll leave the question open a few more days before clicking 'accept' on any one, but you all have my gratitude and I hope others will benefit anywhere near as much as I have.</em> ]</p>

<p><strong>What I don't know</strong> is what succeeding in this path truly requires in time committment and family support. </p>

<p>Right now I can handle a 12-14 credit course schedule with 3.7-4.0 GPA (in the top 5-10% for college and program, dean's list, etc), work part-time, and still have time to be home and not have a burn-out/breakdown - and the academics are the easy part by far! I could do more, but I need to work more too. </p>

<p><strong>What I really need to know</strong> is how sharply different is the time/dedication curve of graduate work and above. I realize each step is a filter that removes most of the entrants (most people don't get a degree, most who do don't attend/finish graduate school, most who do don't seek a PhD,  most who do don't seek/gain professorship...and on and on). But I don't know how severe the stepping is - I'm not talking ""tenured professor at MIT or bust"" - I realize that bar is many orders of magnitude higher.</p>

<p><strong>Background Details:</strong> As an ""adult, returning"" undergraduate student with a (disabled) wife and kids, I'm halfway through a bachelor degree now. I've located a field of study (in a focus of Industrial Engineering) that has made me very interested in altering my life path to include seeking a Masters and maybe even a PhD/professorship (my father was a professor, so its not a purely novel concept to me). I've met and spoken with my advisor and 2 other professors with experience in related fields, and all is encouraging; I have a graduate school in mind, I've received lots of great advice on preparing for school (on this forum and in person), I test well (no GRE fears remain), good grades/class rank, good prospects for future strong referal letters, etc - a comparitively charmed existence for which I am very grateful! I just have to investigate whether I can make it through with an intact, cared for family!</p>

9771,"<p>I'm a PhD student in physics, and I sometimes tutor undergrads in introductory physics classes on the side. Now, there's widespread agreement among people who teach or tutor physics that the only way to effectively learn the material is to <em>use</em> it, generally by working through practice problems in homework assignments and sample exams.</p>

<p>But recently I was contacted by a student who was interested in ""tutoring,"" where by use of the quotes I mean that what she wanted was for <em>me</em> to do problems, and she would watch and ask questions when she was confused about something. At one point this student wrote a long email full of what seemed like psychological mumbo-jumbo trying to justify her assertion that she actually learns that way, and that the normal method of having <em>her</em> do the work would not be effective. I didn't believe it (thus I declined the tutoring assignment), but was I wrong? Are there actually students who don't learn by doing the work, and for whom it <em>is</em> a more effective strategy to just show them how to go through a problem? I would definitely appreciate pointers to educational psychology research on the matter, if anyone knows of any.</p>

<p>Note that I'm not talking about how to teach a topic for the first time, to a group of students who have never seen it before. In that case I know a bit of demonstration is necessary. The situation I'm asking about is reviewing for a final exam, where the student would (or should) have already learned the material in class and completed a homework assignment or two on it.</p>

He said that chapter x is not necessary, or it can be replaced by a literature survey (instead of presenting original work - as I proposed during the thesis proposal).

9827,"<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Young male graduate student in his first year of a PhD program who has lost his passion for the academic world. Seriously considering quitting but don't know what to do. Science background. Would love some advice from anyone.</p>

<p>So, as the title says I'm thinking about leaving my Doctoral program. I'll give you guys (and gals) the rundown of my situation. I'll be withholding specifics to try and keep anonymity, but I'll try and give the best information as I can. This will likely be very long.</p>

<p><strong>My background</strong>
Young male (21-25), with a Science background, B.Sc in Physics. Took a year off between Undergrad and Grad school and worked full time as a research scientist. Theoretical background (most of my work has consisted of modeling). Strong quantitative and computer skills. Excel in presentation/project focused environments.</p>

<p><strong>General Information</strong>
I am currently finishing the second semester of my first year in a PhD program at a top tier US school in an engineering program. I have a full scholarship that pays for all of my tuition and a living stipend (typical graduate student stipend ~$1800 a month after taxes, so quite enough to live off of). I'm not a US citizen (from Canada), so I'm here on a student VISA, so if I decide to stop I have 2 weeks to leave the country. I cannot hold any other employment in the US while here on my VISA. My PhD consists of ~1.5 years of combined coursework and research, followed by a qualifier at the end of that period (research based), then into your thesis (doesn't have to be related to what your qualifier research was on).</p>

<p><strong>Current Academic Situation</strong> 
As I said, I am currently finishing my second semester. I came first semester ready to start a new life...(first time moving away from home- did my undergrad where I was born). I did very well first semester (3.9/4.0 GPA) and research was on track (mostly lit. review). By the end of first semester however, I noticed that I was losing interest very quickly in both my coursework and research - it started to become very hard to get myself through to work on a daily basis. Went home Christmas break for a few weeks and came back to start my second semester and immediately noticed a big change. I started to struggle in my classes and fall behind on research. It wasn't that the material was too difficult, I just had no motivation to do it. No excuses here - just didn't really want to do it so I didn't. I reached the end of the semester and realized just how far behind I was. I am likely going to hit ~C average this semester (A last) and am drastically behind on research. I had weekly-biweekly meetings with my supervisor all semester, but I sort of hid from him just how bad things were going. Had a long meeting with him last week where I basically came clean on everything (told him I was struggling in classes, behind on research) and he was very supportive. He maintain that be believed in my potential and suggested I speak to a school councilor and emphasized that this kind of thing was common for doctoral students.</p>

<p><strong>Personal situation/feelings</strong> 
I come from a family where both my parents have PhDs. Although my parents have always been supportive and open to my life, I feel as though they would be very disappointed if I quit and this pressure is very real to me. I have tried to have the conversation with them and their attitude is mostly: ""just put your head down and work through it, it's just a phase"". Quite frankly most people seem to think it's a ""phase"" when I tell them. Outside of school my life is great. I'm not unhappy or depressed, I have hobbies, friends, I work out - it's just school that makes me feel this way. I just don't like the academic world at all anymore. I HATE classes (always have) and where in the past research has been the saving grace keeping me interested in school, it now is losing a lot of it's appeal.</p>

<p>Basically, I feel no passion or drive for what I am doing anymore. This for me is a huge problem. I'm not the kind of guy who lacks passion in life. Quite the opposite in fact - I will just about kill myself trying for things I love to do/want. I have incredible drive when I want something, but when I don't...I don't. Right now I have no such drive for school. I have a long term long distance relationship with a girl from home that is incredibly happy and stable. She has visited here many times since I moved and we are doing great. I would be lying if I said it wasn't a factor in me wanting to quit. I hate being away from her and If I moved back home, we would likely move in together almost immediately. Asking her to move here is a lot more complicated because unless we are married (probably too soon), she needs a work/student visa to be here on a permanent basis, and that would severely limit her options given she'd basically need to come directly where I am. She has been incredibly supportive and is very aware of my current situation and has maintained a very neutral stance, trying to play devils advocate wherever possible and trying to make sure she doesn't influence the decision. I should state that I am pretty sure if I had to choose between school and her, I would choose her immediately with no regrets.</p>

<p>Basically I have just reached a point where I find myself doing just about anything else but schoolwork. I'll get groceries, clean the apartment, watch TV etc... before doing any work. I'm trying to stick around for a couple of months for the summer (to see if not having classes changes anything) but since talking to my supervisor I'm already having doubts about even that. At this point, I feel like moving home and getting any job would make me happier than what I am doing.</p>

<p><strong>Financial situation</strong> 
I have a few thousand dollars in the bank (enough to get me home /move out etc...) and zero debt. If I move back home, I can likely live with my parents for the first month to get back, then I'd be looking for a job and moving in with my girlfriend. I realize having no debt puts me a head of a lot of people and I'm not particularly concerned about the situation financially - I'm very lucky to have what I have and am aware of this.
So what's the deal I know I have this amazing opportunity. I'm at a top tier school on a full scholarship. I wake up every day and get to work with the top minds in my field doing important research. I'm doing something a very small % of the population ever gets a chance at and yet still I have no motivation to do it. I'm not sure if I'm doing it for me anymore, or I'm doing it so I don't let down other people in my life. My parents, mentors, friends, all the people who keep telling me how amazing this opportunity is. The more I look back, the more I realize that Grad school was what I did because I basically just didn't have another plan.</p>

<p><strong>What would I like to do</strong> 
I'd love to find a job. I don't need to make a lot of money to be happy - I live off of 22k a year right now and am perfectly comfortable. Money isn't a major motivator for me. (Obviously more money isn't bad, but it isn't important in what I do, I only want to make enough to not be very worried about my financial situation). Working in the financial sector, doing quantitative risk analysis, banking, DoD, just about anything sounds more appealing than school to me. I know I'm a smart guy and I've got a strong quantitative background combined with very good personal skills. I'm great with people and one of the things I HATE about the academic world is how under-used that part of my skill set feels.
I have no idea what to do. I want to quit, but I haven't. Maybe I shouldn't? I've been looking into options, but quite frankly I'd much prefer to have some kind of plan before quitting - at the very least this pays my living right now. I'd love advice from anyone. Someone who's been in this situation, someone who hasn't It doesn't matter.
I know that what I am doing does not make me happy. But I don't know what will. Please help.</p>

The issue is: if someone in the research group submitted a scientific paper to a conference, and it was accepted, should he/she go all alone to the conference, or with other group members?</p>

<p>Basically, I found two different way of thoughts:</p>

<p>1) since money is always lacking, and it is important to broaden the scientific discoveries and to have new professional relationships, <strong>only the main author of the paper should go to the conference, all alone</strong>. If everyone goes to a different conference, the team works will better scatter, and they will get more visibility.</p>

<p>2) since to work as a group, it is important to think as a group and, above all, to team up (if there is enough money), <strong>all the paper authors or all the research group should go to the conference</strong>. This way the group will team up and personal relationships between the research group members will strengthen.</p>

9910,"<h3>The question</h3>

<p>When a journal (such as one of the Nature family) asks for information about authors' contributions, what is the most effective way to answer this, to ensure that the co-authorship is assigned as intended, and to ensure that reality is represented: that <strong>the work is a product of the intellectual environment of the whole team; and that all members have contributed in various degrees to the analytical methods used, to the research concept, and to the experiment design</strong>. Is what I've just written there sufficient, or is there a more judicious phrasing that is accepted by heavyweight journal publishers such as the Nature Group?</p>

<h3>The context</h3>

<p>The primary context is publications from a team that works on the principle that all members of the team are to be named authors on all papers coming out of the team.</p>

<p><strong>I'm very specifically looking for answers from editors who handle such papers; or from members of teams with similar rules.</strong> Answers from others are of course possible, but I'd value direct personal experience.</p>

<p>Here's the <a href=""http://www.icmje.org/ethical_1author.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Vancouver Group's (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors) statement on the subject</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Authorship credit should be based on 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published. Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3.</p>
  
  <p>When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should identify the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript. These individuals should fully meet the criteria for authorship/contributorship defined above, and editors will ask these individuals to complete journal-specific author and conflict-of-interest disclosure forms. When submitting a manuscript authored by a group, the corresponding author should clearly indicate the preferred citation and identify all individual authors as well as the group name. Journals generally list other members of the group in the Acknowledgments. The NLM indexes the group name and the names of individuals the group has identified as being directly responsible for the manuscript; it also lists the names of collaborators if they are listed in Acknowledgments.</p>
  
  <p>Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research group alone does not constitute authorship.</p>
  
  <p>All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify should be listed.</p>
  
  <p>Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><sub><strong>The caveats</strong>:</sub></p>

<p><sub> 1. My field is not medicine: I've used the Vancouver Group's guidelines, as I haven't yet found any in my field.</sub></p>

<p><sub> 2. note that this is emphatically not about the ethics, pros and cons of such a rule. If you want to discuss that, please do so in <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2496/academia"">chat</a>. I may join you there as time allows</sub></p>

9946,"<p>In trying to plan for the future and decide on preferred programs and career paths, I'm trying to figure out the seemingly Byzantine nature of how academic funding sources interact. I am particularly confused about how departmental/institutional funding effect fellowships or grant money.</p>

<p>To give a specific example to illustrate the general point that I'm asking about, consider this <a href=""http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/student_info/prospective.html"">FAQ for Prospective Students</a> at Carnegie Mellon, where it is stated anyone accepted into the PhD program can expect their tuition to be paid by the program/waived, and a stipend of ~$24k per year. The page also suggests applying for a fellowship like the <a href=""http://www.cmu.edu/pier/program.applic/program.app.html"">PIER Program</a>, which states it provides about a $30k stipend + $10k towards tuition. Another possibility would be something like the SMART Scholarship, which provides tuition assistance, stipend, and allows non-interfering fellowships.</p>

<p>This is all well and good individually, but what happens if you get department funding and a fellowship like this PIER program? Does the department keep its funding entirely and you only get the greater of the two? If your tuition is paid because of your position, does the contribution of a fellowship towards tuition just give your school some extra funding but does not effect your financial situation individually? And how does a SMART scholarship factor in?</p>

<p>Please note I'm not solely interested in this limited example (as it would be of interest to so few people), but more generally how this works in academia across programs and institutions. I'm in the US, though surely how this sort of thing works in other countries would be valuable to know anyway.</p>

<p>As a second example, consider something like a SMART scholarship and then getting a TA/RA position (which they allow) which earns tuition remittance. Does the scholarship funding source get the tuition remitted back to them, or does any part of the tuition remittance get returned to the student? </p>

<p>The bottom line is deciding the real affordability of various institutions and living areas if you expect to need significantly more than a single stipend amount (raising a family, helping kids pay for their college, etc), and of course to help to decide if seeking certain scholarships and fellowships has a sufficient potential ROI for the time required to seek them.</p>

9974,"<p>At my university, there is no grading on a PhD transcript. There is no exam or predefined coursework (i.e. you can work on any aspect of the dissertation and in any order, which is not assessed but reviewed by the supervisor). At the end of the program (three years), the candidate must submit a dissertation for examination. </p>

<p>The PhD dissertation is examined by internal and external examiners and their reports give either a  pass or a fail. There are various shades (e.g. pass, pass with minor revision, pass with major revision, fail, fail but allowed to resubmit, fail with a lesser award, fail with no award etc.). </p>

<p>The final transcript states ""satisfactory progress"" for each semester of enrolment and ""pass"" for the final semester. The graduation then takes place and the degree is awarded.</p>

<p>I recently had a request to provide the transcript of my PhD. The problem I have is that ""satisfactory progress"" and ""pass"" can both be seen as equivalent to a ""C"" grade (as per the key to grading that explains the grading for all university programs e.g. bachelors degree) I know this is not the case for a PhD. (I got some outstanding feedback from the examiners!)</p>

<p><strong>How do I reconcile this situation?</strong> </p>

<p>I know I can alawys provide the examiners' reports but each report is close to 10 pages, with positive and negative comments. The award of the PhD is subject to the candidate making changes to the dissertation as per the examiners' comments (or otherwise defending why the examiners' comments are not valid in regard to the study). The final dissertation is not the same as the one the examiners assessed and in almost all cases it is a better product (hence the examiners's comments are no longer a true reflection).</p>

<p><strong>How does the grading of PhD work in other universities?</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The 'issue' with no grades being available is that the Official Academic Transcript lists the six semesters (three years) with ""Satisfactory Progress"" for the first five semesters and ""Pass"" for the last semester. On the back is the grading information (i.e. what ""Satisfactory Progress"" and ""Pass"" mean). ""Satisfactory Progress"" is coded SP and means meeting all requirements to progress to the next course in a sequence of courses in a postgraduate research program and ""Pass"" is coded ""C"" and means demonstrated satisfactory levels of achievements in all objectives designated as essential for passing the course. The grading information also provides information on the highest grade which is HD (High Distinction) through to the lowest grade F (Fail). In this situation, why shouldn't a person see ""Pass"" as a C grade for a PhD!</p>

Still, there is one point I haven't seen discussed as I wanted, it's the time and the way the student should be investing in catching up on his field and his specific topic, I'm speaking about the bibliographic part. For sure a student needs a lot of (continuous) input, but at the end he'll be solely judged on his output. From my previous research project, I'm not really confident in my way of balancing between going through articles/textbook material and trying to solve my own problematics. To be honest, it sometimes feels like a sneaky way of procrastinating: I'd tell myself that I'm still not ready to tackle my problem and that I need to make a little ""detour"" by existing works; and when it's done I don't feel more at ease to answer my questions. Or is it a normal aspect of research?</p>

<p>In my specific case, I'll be working on a quite new subject (string theory) when I only had advanced lecture of quantum field theory and general relativity; so I'm thinking about going through the canonical textbook on the subject during the summer, do most of the exercises and derivations in there (which already represents hundreds of hours invested), maybe revising some mathematical tools I need to be really familiar with. Once I'll have a general idea of the topic I'll jump to the main articles in relation to my thesis. I also know that I will be using numerical tools (Monte Carlo methods) and will need to get conformable with that. So far I only have a superficial knowledge and use of the tool.

Three weeks ago I finished a paper draft and left University B for a new internship. Me and professor A were planning to submit the paper draft to a conference (deadline: May 20). </p>

<p>Until yesterday (May 17), the order of authors was: me, professor A, other students &amp; collaborators in the lab... And professor A had no objection with that. However, last night I received an email from him. He said he wants to be the first author... His reason was for intellectual properties and patent issues. My understanding is that because I was merely an intern at University B, if the first author was me, it would cause IP troubles for him?</p>

<p>Looking on the Internet, I found something that might explain professor A's motivations: 
In China specifically, corresponding authors are often underappreciated by universities and research institues. This might be the case for University B. Given professor A is relatively young, he may want first authorship for promotion.</p>

<ol>
<li>Should I go discuss with professor A and try to persuade him to let me be the first author?</li>

<li>My affiliation for the paper has always been University B. I didn't mention my current university or internship in any sense.</li>

I can imagine that I might have an answer that is different than the other teacher (perhaps my answer is wrong, perhaps my answer is right, and perhaps both of us are right but we have different ways of looking at a problem).

Can a startup claim that an ""algorithm"" (which already exists in the literature) was used by me in some form at a later point of time for work unrelated to that domain? Additionally, I intend to use or publish research methods developed as part of my doctoral research during its course or in future. Does ""without limitation ...respective information concerning research, experimental work, development"" restrict me from doing this i.e can the organization restrict me from publishing work done in my doctoral program by claiming that I was also working with them during this period, so they have a right to what i publish during this time?</p></li>

Instead of spending a lot of time trying to figure out if there is a good result buried somewhere in the mess, I'm tempted to just fail such a work as unreadable.</p>

<p>While these (I'd say) formal aspect don't reflect the ability of the student to solve the problem, it strongly reflects his/her ability to present the solution. And in their future professions, it won't be much good that they can solve problems, if they're not able to present the solution to someone else. Or for example grant agencies simply reject proposals that fail even slightly given formal criteria.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Should the evaluation include evaluation of readability, proper structure etc. for example in a textual form (without impacting the final grade perhaps), something like <em>""The solution is completely unreadable.""</em> or for a larger work <em>""The solution lacks a proper structure - there is no introduction or conclusion of what have been accomplished.""</em> etc.?</li>
<li>Should such deficiencies be also reflected in the grade? If so, how much? Would it be acceptable to even fail a work just because it's completely unreadable?</li>

<p>The largest honour society is perhaps the <a href=""http://www.goldenkey.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Golden Key</a> which operates worldwide and has over 2 million members. It provides a range of services to members, including leadership training, networking and the opportunity to do good. Membership is by invitation only and only those who are in the top 15% of their class or high performing graduate students are eligible. The eligibility is based solely on academic performance.</p>

<p>I presume being invited to join a honour society is an 'honour' in itself, as the mere mention of this affiliation on the CV would indicate that you are a top achiever. </p>

10183,"<p>I was asked to compose a recommendation/reference letter for a Computer Engineer that works as a Researcher in the Research Center i am supervisor. I dont know if Academia is the right site to post , but since the nature of the job is Research and people involved ""Research Engineers"" , i believe is the right place.</p>

<p>So , i need to write a great recommendation/reference letter, but the problem is i never wrote a letter of this kind before. I ve seen many of them , and even more on the web but the problem is that they all look ""copy-pasted"" and not written in a way that would make me believe that the author of this letter really spent time on it , believing in the skills of his employee and really wanted to recommend him.</p>

<p>I ve already wrote the letter , the best i could and i will like to ask about some parts of it , how they sound and if they could get any better.</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> As a first paragraph  , i wrote who i am , the position i have in the Research Center and what is the purpose of this letter:</p>

<pre><code>my name is .. i am a .... 

The purpose of this letter, is to serve as a reference to my cooperation with Mr ...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2)</strong> In the second paragraph i wrote about the position of the person (Research Engineer) and for how long he worked with us:</p>

<pre><code>Mr. X  joined our team in the X Research Center as a full-time Research Engineer under an ongoing X month contract...
</code></pre>

<p>At this point i dont know how i could point out better the fact the the person was under a normal full-paid contract and not just given a ""European Grant"" to work with us. I wrote he is a <code>full-time</code> , but still there are many people that join programs after studies that work for a few months as Engineers in Research Centers. In this case , i want to stress that he was working as normal Research Engineer , especially chosen for his skills and payed a normal salary for his position as Engineer. Maybe add something like <code>""full payed contract""</code></p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> In the 3rd paragraph i wrote under what framework the person worked(European project) and a few words where and how he was involved. I didnt want to go into great details here as i believe this stuff could be easily read from his great cv. Or is it wise to describe exactly what he did(Names of real-life applications that was part of developing etc). I pointed out that he was deeply involved in what he did , how well he integrated with the rest of the people how motivated he was and that he actively contributed in the project. Anything else i could add here?</p>

<p><strong>4)</strong> As a last line i would like to show that i cant recommend him enough , but without getting ""too excited"". I want it to be serious, i want it to leave no doubts. Also since the person is young , he is interested in continuing with post graduate studies , or working as a Researcher or even getting a computer engineer position in a private company. Is it ok if i mention all of them? Usually we recommend someone for one type of position. But his position , working as computer engineer doing research(aka Research Engineer) , leaves no doubt that he would be great as a phD student , as a researcher or as a software engineer. So i wrote:</p>

<pre><code>For all the aforementioned reasons I would like to highly recommend X , as a strong candidate for future postgraduate studies , research and employment offers.
</code></pre>

<p>What do you think about it? How could i make it better and is there something i should change? If you dont like some part and you give me an alternative please point out why you dont like the part , as some times its a bit of personal taste and not that something is wrong. Would be great , if you could post some examples of letters you composed or parts of them , or an example from the web that you consider great.</p>

<p>I am soon (maybe...) going to graduate with a thesis-based MS in a technical field. The past year and a half has been incredibly frustrating from a research perspective, as my advisor has insisted on telling me exactly what and how to research, essentially prohibiting me from exploring any of my ideas which are not approved by him. </p>

<p>I believe this is because I unfortunately chose a research area for my MS directly related to his PhD work from some time ago.</p>

It will make you stop what you are currently doing and possible spend up to 2 months making the changes. This might make a big mess on your work if you have deadlines to respect, however this happens to everyone in academia.</p>

10340,"<p>Back in my university days, I got into the habit of saving papers I had to read to my hard disk. At first I did this simply to organize them more conveniently, and have quicker access to them. </p>

<p>However, my reasons for saving those papers to disk gradually changed as graduation approached.

<p>Years later, I now frequently end up in discussions, or get asked questions, or otherwise end up at a point where a common access to one of those papers really helps to progress the discussion. I often just send that paper around without thinking twice about it, more because I believe that's how science should work than anything else. </p>

He loves to teach, but hates the endless grind of ""administrivia"", the low pay, and the mental laziness of the students he's required to teach.

If I go to the NSA, no one will hire me in an academic position.  If I become an actuary (because we do need more money) then all of my time will be sucked into studying for exams, and I still won't be able to do research.""

10451,"<p>I'm currently uploading my MRes thesis to my university website, but I have some doubts regarding the permanence of the link as it may change after I graduate. I do not have many illusions over who may want to read my thesis in the future, but I would like to have a link to give to people or to put on papers in the future without fear of the link breaking in the near/mid/far future. Additionally, I know that having it available in a place spiders are more likely to look makes it (marginally) more visible to web searches and thus more discoverable.</p>

<p>A <a href=""http://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all%3a+AND+PhD+thesis/0/1/0/all/0/1"">quick search</a> turns up a good bunch of PhD theses, but it doesn't say how many there aren't very many <a href=""http://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all%3a+AND+MSc+thesis/0/1/0/all/0/1"">MSc</a> or <a href=""http://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all%3a+AND+BSc+thesis/0/1/0/all/0/1"">BSc</a> theses in there.

10452,"<p>I am an electrical engineering (communications) undergraduate student. But my main interest is physics ( and/or CS, esp. it's common fields with physics - <em>but it doesn't affect my question here</em> ), and I want to pursue my graduate studies in physics or computer science. However for application, as an engineering student  I'm at a disadvantage as </p>

<ul>
<li>I think my major is not considered <em>rigorous enough</em> by people in those fields </li>
<li>I don't have much (official) coursework in those fields, although I have studied (and am studying) even more than is expected from physics majors</li>
<li>because of the time I've put in studying ( and more importantly, exploring different areas of) physics and computer science,  my GPA so far is not good in electrical engineering.</li>
</ul>

10458,"<p>I have some questions regarding my personal statement for graduate school in math. I hope this is not the wrong place to ask. My question(s) are comprehensive and long, as the title suggests, thus I have numbered and sub-numbered the questions.</p>

<p>Note that these questions are targeted at schools that do not allow me to upload a CV otherwise I think half of these questions would go away.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Courses</strong>  </li>
</ol>

<p>1a) Is it silly or a waste of space to talk about your math background? Or should I assume the graduate committee already has this? </p>

<p>1b) Some schools I have checked out actually asked me to list out all my junior/senior courses along with their books, I guess for those schools I don’t need to? What about those who do not?</p>

<p>1c) Should I write or mention courses I have self-studied? Or is this completely irrelevant to them? </p>

<p>1d) Should I also bother explaining one W and one ‘bad’ mark that happened in the summer?</p>

<p>1e) Should I mention my math department is understaffed and I tried to take as many “hard” classes as possible? How understaffed? We have only at most four math classes at the senior level every year. We are so small that most junior/senior classes stop only at the introductory level. </p>

<p>For example, we only have: introductory PDE, introductory Number Theory, introductory Algebra, and Topology does not even exist at my university. </p>

<p>Very rarely do we get continuations to those courses. In comparison with all the other areas, we have quite a lot of Analysis courses, but all of them are focused in Optimization (excluding Real Analysis, we usually have one to two Analysis classes).</p>

<p>We have no Calculus of Variation, no Measure Theory, almost nothing. </p>

<p>FYI, I had to go out my way to bug a professor to request an extra Analysis course this year to the unit head and even then I am short on Math classes next year.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>TA experience</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>2a) Should I talk about this? How will they even verify me? Because I have done some things that most TA don’t do at my university – writing exam solutions. The prof I TA’d for left everything for me to do, except the teaching and actually writing the midterms/finals. I never had a class with him, so I am not so sure about asking him to write a letter for me.</p>

<p>2b) I also TA’d for another prof at another campus during one summer term(same university, but different Math department), should I mention this? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: <strong>I can provide a link of my exam solutions through the prof's site. I think he will give me permission, should I include this?</strong></p>

<p>3) <strong>Research Experience</strong></p>

<p>I have <em>very very</em> little experience, so much that I could probably only write one or two short sentences about it. I also have no publication, but I think the prof I worked for can<br>
confirm that I did do research under him. </p>

<p>By the way, the “research experience” I had was a problem the prof had written by hand on a math paper and he asked me to answer the question he posed. It was not an analytic problem, it was coding, graphing, and writing a report. </p>

<p>4) <strong>Area of Interest.</strong></p>

<p>4a) I already know my area of interest, I am wondering if it is a good idea to write why I got interested in the first place or is this completely irrelevant to the graduate committee? </p>

<p>My reasons are rather absurd, I am going into my desired area because of a textbook writer and the textbook I read by him isn’t even the area I was interested in, although the writer did write a book in the subject and I was simply in love with his style of writing.</p>

<p>I later found out the writer’s background and plus some neat stuff I read on the Internet sealed the deal for me. If people think this reason isn’t silly or “cliché” (e.g. “I liked puzzles when I was young”), then please tell me.</p>

<p>4b) Also one major problem is that I can’t talk too deeply about my area of interest. i can mention specific subfields, but that's about it. For instance, if I liked Number Theory, I could mention ""Analytic Number Theory"" and the ""Riemann Zeta"" or if I liked Differential Geometry/PDE, I could mention ""Geometric Analysis"". </p>

<p>So would it be better to omit the details if I can't comment too much on the details of the subject and simply write ""Number Theory""? </p>

<p>5) <strong>Thesis Advisor</strong></p>

<p>I can find people and mention their names easily on my personal statement. I am just curious if I should narrow it down to only ONE person? Does it look bad that I am just listing out the people whom I want to work with instead of writing down just one name?</p>

<p>6) <strong>Scholarships/Award</strong></p>

<p>I have never liked the word 'Award', so i am going to use 'Scholarship'. Do I need to mention about a scholarship I got from a professor? Again, how can I be verified for this? I think I could ask the prof who gave it to me (whom I did reasearch for) to mention/confirm this?</p>

<p>7) <strong>Skills</strong></p>

<p>How much will it add to my application if I tell them I can use LaTeX (honor's thesis not required for honors degree at my university. I asked one of my profs why and even he doesn't know.), high proficiency with Mathematica, Maple, Matlab, etc...? I was going to add Photoshop, but then I realize how pointless and irrelevant that is. I can also use Python, but since I am postponed my 1st year computer science requirements till my last year I do not think they will buy this. Also my school teaches Java.</p>

10470,"<p>I've just written my first mathematical research paper. It proves some new results, which while not ground-breaking are (according to an expert in the field) at least somewhat interesting and surprising. At the moment however, I spend more of the paper developing the background material (giving standard definitions and constructions, proving standard lemmas) than proving the main theorems. </p>

<p>Is this a problem? The way I see it, there are several arguments for and against:</p>

<p><strong>For:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The background material is ""standard"" in the sense that anyone who works on this class of problems would know the definitions or results in some form. However, this is at most a few hundred people, while if I include the background material my paper should be comprehensible to an advanced undergraduate.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the background results are part of the folklore of the field, and I've never been able to find a proof of them in literature. While they are believable and not hard to prove, I feel someone should bother doing it. More selfishly, this is one more reason for people to cite my paper.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't know of any one reference which states <em>all</em> the background material I need, so if I don't include it my readers have to chase down multiple sources and I have to use conflicting notations.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Against:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>It may be annoying to an expert in the field, although they could skip much of it and mainly refer to the background section for notation.</p></li>
<li><p>It makes the paper longer, although even with the background the paper is not long (13 pages).</p></li>
<li><p>From what I've heard, it is generally considered bad practice to restate definitions and constructions states elsewhere and to reprove theorems available in literature. In part this is because it gives the impression that I haven't read the literature. This is exacerbated by the fact that I only cite ~5 previous works, mostly for further reading or alternative presentations of some of the background.</p></li>

<p>Having read <a href=""http://chronicle.com/article/Rise-of-Altmetrics-Revives/139557/?cid=wc&amp;utm_source=wc&amp;utm_medium=en"">Rise of Altmetrics</a>, I started to wonder what would be the best way to measure the impact on my publications. I do care for many reasons but one of the reasons is to impress others enough to be able to get a job/promotion/tenure.</p>

<p>So, my question is, do hiring committees take alternative metrics (Facebook likes, mentions in blog posts, etc.) seriously when trying to measure the impact of someone's work or are other issues like impact factor more important?</p>

<p>I know there is the h-index (with its own flaws) but that seems to measure my publications as one unit (all publications taken together, therefore measuring me overall). I'm more interested in measuring the impact publication by publication in order to show an improving trend.</p>

<p>On a side note, it seems that there is a general feeling that a publication in a high impact factor journal equals a high impact publication. This feels a little off to me since one might convince the editor their work is important while at the same time fail to convince their academic community of the same.</p>

10494,"<p>I have been working on an idea for last 2 years almost independently along with other research works. Recently, I am getting encouraging results with a lot of success to solve a complex problem using that idea. I have not published the work yet. Initially, my advisors were not at all interested in the idea and insisted that I spend my time in other research projects. I pursued it with my interest in spite of any support but with new results and potential benefit of the approach my advisors became extremely interested and even described the work as the next big thing in our lab meetings. I am happy about it or maybe they say it to make me happy.
However, recently I encountered a situation which was difficult for me to digest. I found my advisors present a perspective paper along with many other renowned experts in the field, proposing and highlighting the approach I have been working on as the future direction in the field along with other important developments in a conference. Even though I was not a co-author in that paper, I did not consider it something wrong alluding myself that it was an advertisement to the work I was doing. I happened to attend the conference as a PhD student, and found that the presenter of the perspective paper (whom I don't know) presented more than half of his talk on my idea with my slides that I shared with my advisors. </p>

<p>People really liked the idea and the approach and many are convinced that the idea is going to impact the field. While I saw a very drastic change in the way my advisors treated me recently, but what really made me sad was when my advisor asked me to refer to this perspective paper (to which I was not a co-author) in my impending submission (on the idea) to a journal.  </p>

<p>I feel like it was unfair but I don't know if research is done this way in academia or if it is perfectly legit to do something like that.

10518,"<p>This past year I was accepted into two mid range phd programs in mathematics without funding. Here's what my profile looked like:</p>

<p>Domestic White Male
Unknown state school in the midwest
Majors: Mathematics and Philosophy
GPA: 3.93
GRE:
Q: 168 (97)
V: 167 (97)
W: 5.0 (92)
M: not taken</p>

<p>Interests: Analysis, Medical Imaging/Modeling, Mathematical Physics</p>

<p>Major Coursework:
Complex Analysis, Discrete Structures, Applied Math (survey course mostly in Fourier methods and PDEs), Mathematical Statistics.</p>

<p>Recommendations:
One from a top applied mathematician who was very late in sending them out, one from a professor from the previous year who is well regarded but has not had much contact with me and one from a young professor who was fresh out of post doc.</p>

<p>Other:
I'm 30 years old. Some former work experience as a co-op student in engineering at a national lab, dean's list, normal stuff like that. I had only completed two semesters at my current school, though. About 6 years ago I was an engineering student at a different institution with poor grades and I did not finish my degree. Also mid to high level (lots of national, some international competition) as an athletic coach working with kids, teens and adults. Some international experience as an athlete as well. I also speak basic German.</p>

<p>Here's how my profile has changed:</p>

<p>Current GPA: 3.94 (.01 difference! However, this does mean 6 more As and 1 more A- to counterbalance my poor record from the early-mid 2000s.)</p>

<p>GRE Subject Score: 660 (52)</p>

<p>Additional Coursework: Formal Logic, Real Analysis, Advanced Linear Algebra, Intro to Abstract Algebra. This summer I am doing a course in number theory and an independent study in Galois theory.</p>

<p>Recommendations: I am going to give the late professor a much longer lead time this time around. He has said that he wants to help me but is always extremely busy. I will also be asking (and almost certainly receiving) a rec from the professor I am doing my independent study with.</p>

<p>Interests in pure math have shifted away from analysis, more into algebra. In applied, medical applications (organ/system modeling and imaging more than bioinformatics) have taken the lead over mathematical physics.</p>

<p>Other changes: Medalist in school's math competition, math tutor in our honors college and privately. Taking a Spanish immersion course so I can list basic spanish on there as well.</p>

<p>I'll be taking the GRE subject again in October and am using saylor.org and MIT's opencourseware to review older subjects. I graduate in August and will be working for a year. I'm thinking about applying to teach at a high school or community college for that time. I also plan on taking one or two graduate courses per semester.</p>

<p>I plan on applying all over the place (>15 apps) compared to the 8 from last time. I would prefer to go to the west coast. Can anyone let me know if the mid level UCs (Irvine, Santa Barbara, Davis) are reasonable with what I've got now, especially since when I worked at that national lab I was technically a UC employee? Any other recommendations on schools or anything I can do over the next year to boost this?</p>

<p>One other thing: I have no REUs, but is a good independent study with a strong recommendation from it a decent substitute?</p>

10519,"<p>This might sound like a silly question, but I am not a native speaker of English, so I find it sometimes difficult to write my first draft in that language. What I usually do is write my first draft in Italian, my mother tongue, and then translate it into English.

10522,"<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: I'm a pure math graduate student who doesn't like research mathematics. Should I continue and get the PhD because I suspect I might like teaching at a 4-year liberal arts college?</p>

<hr>

<p>I am currently in a pure math PhD program at a fairly good university. I just finished my second year there, and after passing qualifying exams have been awarded a Master's.</p>

<p>Ever since I arrived in grad school, I have been fairly dissatisfied. I went to grad school because math in undergrad felt relevant, and I loved the feeling of leaping from logical lily-pad to logical lily-pad en route to proving something. In grad school, though, these feelings have become fewer and far between. I feel like things have become more mechanical and more like banging my head against a wall. For the most part, I find it very difficult to motivate myself to do my work; I never look forward to getting started in the morning. I have finished required courses and qualifying exams, but the difficulty continues as I do a reading course in preparation for work with an advisor.</p>

<p>Overall, I have realized that research math is not for me. I have quite enjoyed my teaching experiences, which so far consist of leading recitation sessions, tutoring, and the first week of teaching a summer course. Because of the heavy emphasis on ""teaching to the test"" in secondary education, among other things, I suspect I would enjoy teaching at, say, a liberal arts college more than teaching at a secondary school. However, I feel pretty inexperienced in teaching, and so I don't feel certain by any means about these feelings. This is now the only reason I would want to stay in graduate school. Is this enough reason to continue for the next 3-4 years to the PhD?</p>

<p>According to my advisor, I would be in graduate school another 3-3.5 years for the PhD. I would love to work at a liberal arts institution in the US, but ideally one where the research load is minimal/nonexistent. The impression I got from skimming MathJobs recently was that such positions were relatively rare compared to research-intensive positions. Do you feel like I would be very likely to find such a job if I stayed for the PhD?</p>

<p>Any advice is much appreciated! Thank you, everyone.</p>

  <p><em>This program is for full-time students employed in retail or service stores, agriculture, or colleges and universities. The employer that hires students can obtain a certificate from the Department of Labor which allows the student to be paid not less than 85% of the minimum wage. The certificate also limits the hours that the student may work to 8 hours in a day and no more than 20 hours a week when school is in session and 40 hours when school is out, and requires the employer to follow all child labor laws. Once students graduate or leave school for good, they must be paid at least the federal minimum wage.

10710,"<p>I apologize if this is too long a post, but I could really do with a few
pointers about my current situation.</p>

<p>I am 25 years old and I will complete <strong>4 years</strong> of my PhD in a computational applied mathematics  program in the US in August 2013.</p>

<p>My bachelors was in pure mathematics.  I had gotten interested in numerical analysis in that time and so I had applied to my current PhD program. I have been under my adviser for 3 years now (the first year at my university is spent in coursework).  A PhD at my university is usually 5 years long. </p>

<p>Right now, I have <strong>almost nothing</strong> to report in the way of research, and consequently no publications , no conference submissions. I am getting increasingly nervous and frustrated about whether or not I will make it, <strong>even</strong> if I give myself an extra year by funding myself. </p>

<p>My adviser has consistently been making me work on uninteresting stuff, where most of the work involved is purely technical like writing brain-dead code, with almost zero chance for innovation. </p>

<p><em><strong>BREAKDOWN OF MY PHD</em></strong> </p>

<p>After monkeying around reading research papers, in the <strong>first year</strong> under my adviser,  he got very confident about getting an industrial project and got me working on that, in anticipation that the contract would go through. At the end of the year we found out that we did not get the project.  </p>

<p>In the <strong>second year</strong>, he said he wanted to get into GPU parallel computing 
and to implement a few fluid dynamics algorithms. I slogged over many manuals, spent months and months writing and debugging code, all the time thinking that 
this would be used to do some simulations he was interested in and get them published. But at the end of the second year my professor completely lost interest in these numerical techniques he was making my implement. </p>

<p>Seeing this schizophrenic attitude, I almost wanted to quit then and there itself. But I decided to just stick it out, thinking it might be 'just a phase'.  Due to funding issues, he once more got me working in the <strong>third year</strong> on another project which essentially involved writing a lot of stupid code, and running endless benchmark tests.  </p>

<p>I have basically ended up trying to do a PhD in mathematics without any mathematics in this PhD. </p>

<p>Finally, a couple of weeks back, I told him that I had had enough, and to give me some actual 
problems/material to work with. After about an hour of discussion, and informing him that I was ready to fund my self if required, he finally gave me a couple of possible starting points for what I hope would actually turn out to be worthwhile research.</p>

<p><em><strong>MY QUESTIONS</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I do realize it was <em>extremely</em> foolish waiting for so long before putting my foot down, and not having the courage to speak up before. My adviser is well-regarded by colleagues in his field, and maybe I was subconsciously scared of 
contradicting his handling of my PhD for pissing him off. </p>

<p>But even though he has now suggested problems which do seem interesting, after having had so many negative experiences  I am very skeptical about the future. How should I proceed, and what are the factors I should consider ? </p>

<p>Frankly, I am feeling very burned out.  In the way of future plans, I have been toying with the idea of dropping out,  getting a break for a few months and then sitting for some entrance exams for a Masters in Economics in some good universities back in my home country. I always found economics very interesting through my undergrad and more so these past few-months while studying it has a hobby.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuing would require me to stay on for an extra year till August 2015, 
which leaves me <strong>about 17 months tops</strong> from now, before I start hunting in academic job market. This includes about 2-3 months I will have to spend doing literature review on the proposed topics and learning the requisite mathematical tools. </p>

<p>So if I decide to stay on, how should I re-structure my study/research time and the relationship with my adviser in these 17 months so that I can make some head-way.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe 17 months is too short a time? Any suggestions would be really helpful !!</p>

She writes a great thesis with a good literature review and nice results. However, the results are based on two key papers from previous students in the group.

10798,"<p>Back when my older brother started his PhD degree I asked him what it meant to be a doctor in something other than medicine. I don't recall the exact wording he used, but the idea he portrayed was that you take a field, a narrow and specific field, and you specialise in it to a level at which when you are done, you have become <em>one of the ultimate experts in that very specific field</em>. </p>

<p>For instance if you are working with combustion physics, you might be one of the leading experts in efficient 2 cylinder, ultra-light engines made out of refined aluminium... Alternatively if you are into neuroscience you might be an expert on a particular neurotransmitter re-absorption in a particular zone of the brain following heavy exercise (or whatever, hopefully you get the point). It might be an opinionated view of a PhD but I feel it's a common way to look at a PhD degree; <strong><em>a certification of expertise</em></strong>. </p>

<p>Fast-forward 15 years... I am about half-way in my PhD studies in the highly interdisciplinary field of bioinformatics, where statistics, mathematical modeling, physics, molecular chemistry and programming boil together with cell biology, to top it all you typically have a theme spice, which in my case is cancer biology. I have a growing feeling that I am getting stretched thinner and thinner by the day, instead of becoming increasingly competent in a specific field, I become semi-competent in increasingly many fields. </p>

<p>That being the case I am not sure I (or others like myself) will fit the ""definition"" above. I would appreciate some perspective as to how one should be seeing highly interdisciplinary PhD studies and the development (as a scientist and a professional) that graduate studies entitles. Subsequently, how should one go about to profile him/her-self to future employers, seeing as there is no one natural field to pursue, but rather many different ones. </p>

10960,"<p>Some background:</p>

<ul>
<li>I started my PhD in Machine Learning in April this year.</li>
<li>My PhD is fully funded for 3 years, I earn around 2000€/month after tax, working only on research and not doing any teaching.</li>
<li>I'm paid by the grant that my advisor got for his project. This grant his paid by the state.</li>
<li>My current advisor is a world expert in Machine Learning</li>
<li>I already submitted 2 papers with him and most likely submit a third one in a couple of months.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem: My advisor just got an offer from one of the biggest company you can think of, to do a machine learning project with lots of different world experts newly hired by the said company. It means that he is going to leave his current position at my university in 4 months. </p>

<p>I can't blame him to take this position because I would have done the same. It's an offer that nobody can refuse.</p>

<p>So in 4 months, I'll have to make a choice.</p>

<ul>
<li>leave my position and look for a position elsewhere but I doubt I'll find something as interesting and well paid. (My advisor can write recommendation letter for me.)</li>
<li>to stay at the university and choose a new advisor -> the problem is that my current research is highly technical and nobody except my current advisor (and I) have knowledge about it (he was a new junior professor and the university wanted to expand the CS department). The rest of my group is working on a totally different subject and I know nobody will be able to help me for the rest of my PhD.</li>
</ul>

<p>My advisor told me that the university will find me a new advisor if I choose to stay but warned me that my topic will most likely shift to adapt to the domain knowledge of this new advisor. It means that I'll have to give up my current topic and to tell you the truth, I prefer to quit my PhD than to continue on something that I don't like.</p>

The editors did not respond to this notification. More than two months went by after the re-submission, and I sent a message to the editor asking for a status update, just to be sure that the paper was still being considered and under review.

11004,"<p>Recently two friends of mine have come back to Australia after having done 2 semesters of 3rd and 4th year subjects (about half mathematics) at different branches of the University of California.</p>

<p>They said that the tests would only ask questions directly from or similar to material covered in lectures and example sheets. If questions deviated from the lectures or example sheets very much students would complain to the lecturer. Thus, if one studied the example sheets enough they got an A relatively easily. They returned with A or A+ in all of their maths subjects, but they average about 75-80 for their maths subjects here. 
In Australia, about 70% of the exam is usually like that. The rest are questions that we learned enough theory to feasibly do, but we hadn't seen that type of question before so it requires some level of cleverness to get it within the time limits of the exam. </p>

<p>My questions are</p>

  <p>Can anyone corroborate that the maths tests at american universities are actually like this?</p>
  
  <p>If so, is this well known and accounted for by the people who look at grad school applications from international students? </p>

11011,"<p>I have a question particularly for the math professors here. I just finished my second year as a PhD student at a top30 University, passed all my qualifying exams, and I've begun working with an adviser in an area I'm excited about. Since the end of the Spring semester I've done a LOT of thinking, and I'm not sure academia is for me. The main issue is my perception of the time that will be required (in terms of hours per week) to get tenure. I have a wife and kids, and I just can't sacrifice the time spent with them, even if it means giving up something I love. I figure I could put in 40-45 hours a week, but then I need to be home. My first year of grad school, I put in 60-70 hours a week, and I certainly never want to go back to that. This last year, I've kept it between 40-50, and that seems about right for work/life balance.</p>

<p>So my question is this... am I correct in ruling Academia out for this reason? I had considering smaller colleges, but I'm looking to earn at least $60k and from what research I've done, I won't make that much.</p>

<p>My next question involves research outside Academia. Is there any place for research in combinatorics, asymptotics, probability, and analysis of algorithms outside of Academia, where the work-culture is a typical 40 hour workweek? I see a lot of research in other areas of mathematics that I'm not interested in (PDE's, Scientific/Engineering, Number Theory) -- but not really what I'm interested in.</p>

<p>So with all that, it seems to me that I'm not even sure why I would get a PhD anymore, other than it might open doors, but it's hard to stay motivated when there is no clear goal, or thing to work towards. My current thinking is just take some CS courses and learn some programming languages, get an internship next summer and perhaps leave with a masters after a year or so unless I can think of a very good reason to stay.</p>

11014,"<p>When preparing my PowerPoint slides for a lecture, I often find myself wondering what to put as the final slide.</p>

<p>For presentations in industry, when not in a university setting, I often have a final slide which simply says ""Thank you."" The intent is to thank the audience for attending the presentation. However, this feels a little out of place in a university setting, especially where students may not have a choice of attending (well, the choice is attend or definitely fail).</p>

<p>So, I started using a final slide that says ""Questions?"" However, I recently read something indicating that a teacher should not ask if students have questions (the teacher should either ask a probing question to check for understanding or the teacher should simply expect the students to speak up without prompting).</p>

<p>It seems the final slide should somehow indicate that the slides are done and doing that with a content slide does not seem right either. I recently started using a final slide indicating what homework was expected of the students before the next class session (sometimes the slide simply says 'no homework'). This works several sessions into the semester once students see that every time the homework slide appears it is the final slide; however, it does not really work well at the start of the semester.</p>

11091,"<p>So the title question is not real clear so let me try to elaborate. I am currently 30 and a senior in college. I will be graduating this spring with a BS in Computer Engineering. The way my school is set up the Comp-Sci and Computer Engineering departments are together and the Electrical Engineering department is separate. I expect to graduate with over a 3.5 gpa (not wonderful) but have no research or intern/on the job experiences. I am looking at continuing on at this same institution with their phd program. My gre scores verbal 165, Quantitative 158. Their cut off is 146 verbal and 156 quantitative. I still need to talk with them and see how they utilize the gre scores and see if I need to retake the gre and up my quantitative score. </p>

<p>So from that mediocre beginnings I come to the grand finale. When talking with professors and otherwise looking/learning in my field. How do you find those areas that are new and pushing into the frontier. When I write a letter of intent and they want me to tell them what I want to be doing. Where do I go read up on the new stuff for my major. What are some all around objectives and methods that people use and then specific to computer engineering what are people reading or procuring their resources from.</p>

<p>What other things could I do in this last year that may help my chances of being picked?</p>

<p>As an additional question, Letters of recommendation would be coming from professors from within the department that will be doing the selection. Some of these Professors would be the ones heading my thesis committee(i think that's right). Does anyone have any experience they can relate where they went to grad school at the same institution that they go their BS degree from.  I will have one outside reference as a peer mentor for our freshman engineering program but otherwise most of the professors have seen me go over the top in my work for their classes. </p>

11273,"<p>I'm a westerner doing my PhD in an Asian country. While writing this I've just finished my first year, but I'm getting so fed up with my academical environment that I decided to move my PhD.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why I went to Asia is that I'm in a technological field. Now a days with all these Asian countries up-and-coming, developing innovative products, it felt like a good moment to ride along on their train.</p>

<p>In the last year I'm experiencing major difficulties with my advisor and I'm not sure whether it's because of cultural differences or just me. Let me highlight some of the major issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>When I did my masters, my advisors were actually people who gave me advice. My current professor is somebody who gives orders instead of advice. The big problem with that is that there's usually no room for persuading him with counter arguments. As stubborn as I'm, it usually ends up in me ignoring what he says.</li>
<li>There seems to be a big difference in how I approach weekly meetings. I make a selection of what I investigated during the week and decide myself which direction I go into and thus what I eventually present to him. It seems that he wants every direction thoroughly investigated and presented to him so that he can make a decision about the direction eventually. </li>
</ul>

<p>These and other reasons, I don't think it makes people better. It won't let people think for themselves when they are just following. I got the comment last week that he thinks that my output is too low, but in fact I'm making the most progress, I'm just not presenting as much as everybody else because I make my own decisions upfront. I noticed that I intentionally not share everything with him anymore, because he always manage to turn everything upside down in one hour per week and ends with ""just do it."" Like he always creates the strangest and most complicated experimental designs (e.g., 3x3x3) with factors that I don't think are related. I just want to perform a simple 2x2 design and deepening it more and more based on the results. It just feels very odd that somebody who only gets involved into a project an hour per week gives orders about the direction. </p>

<p>Well the thing is that I seems to be the only one who thinks this is not normal. Since I always hear those stories that doing a PhD is always tough and sometimes makes you hate your advisor, I'd like to know where the problem is. I don't mind toughness, but it needs to serve a goal. Before I'm accepted to a different PhD in another country, I'd like to know if I'm getting in the same situation. If so, I don't think a PhD is the right thing for me then. </p>

Moreover, this question is new and has not been answered in very detail so far.</p>

<p>I have done most of the usual ways described in other resources as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have done a comprehensive review of the relevant literature pertaining to this particular research question. This is a new area and the number of <strong>directly relevant</strong> papers are ~&lt;50. I have also compiled an exhaustive bibliography of the <strong>indirectly relevant</strong> papers in this area. That number is ~&lt;150.</p></li>
<li><p>Out of this set of <strong>directly relevant</strong> literature, I have identified 23 quantitative empirical studies, 14 qualitative empirical studies and the rest are theoretical pieces/position pieces/framework papers.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The challenge I am currently facing is how to meta-analyze the data. In HCI, it is not common to freely distribute empirical datasets (although signs of change are imminent in the atmosphere. :)) and I have sent out polite emails to the relevant researchers inquiring if I could have some manner of access to these datasets. The rate of response is ~50% so far in responding to my email but only about ~5% want to actively share their datasets.</p>

<p>Therefore, the only other option (that I can see right now) is to compile, summarize and make sense of data and results already reported in the qualitative and quantitative papers.</p>

<p>I was wondering if any of you experienced (<em>and also not-so-experienced</em> :)) academicians/researchers had any insights into how to actually go about doing a meta analysis from the bottom up.</p>

<p>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are all the rage when people write about teaching. So many articles have been written about MOOCs killing universities while others complain about the attention. Some have even discussed some community colleges using MOOCs with the classroom teacher filling more of a tutorial role using MOOCs for the bulk of their material.</p>

<p>As I reflect on my own classroom experience (as a lecturer) I find that a lot of my time is spent covering the basics while it would be much more interesting to focus on higher-level concepts. However, in the end, I have only a certain number of hours in the class with my students. If I have 60 hours and it takes 50 hours to cover the basics, there is little time remaining to cover much in the way of higher-level ideas. </p>

<p>So, I've been considering assigning MOOC videos as homework and using class time as discussion time, much the way one would using the case method. While <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/8855/undergraduate-not-doing-homework-case-method"">my experience with the case method</a> has not been fantastic, I'm not ready to give up on it yet. </p>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong> What is the best way to integrate MOOC videos or other videos as part of the curriculum? Are there any major pitfalls that I should consider before completing my plan for the coming semester?</p>

However, there is another question to ask which is similar, but I think different, from these two.</p>

<p>If you have a class of 70 students and you assign some homework on which you will base the following class, and 40% of the students do not do the homework, that subsequent class becomes quite unmanageable. If you proceed as scheduled, the 40% will be lost, they cannot contribute, and eventually become distracting for the rest of the class.</p>

<p>If you do not run the class as scheduled, the students who did the homework the first time will see there is little benefit of doing the home and little cost of not doing it. For this reason, in the past, I have been quite strict. Students who did not do the homework get kicked out and marked absent (too many absences and they automatically fail the module). The problem with this approach is that kicking 40% out leaves me with a very high failure rate and in the end I just end up taking time which would otherwise be free for me to do as I wish and I must dedicate that time to these students who failed (for whatever reason).</p>

<p>So, I find myself in a difficult situation. Kicking students out hurts them but hurts me too. The problem is that I value my time much more than they value theirs so it ends up hurting me more than them. If I don't kick them out, my schedule gets destroyed.</p>

<p>How can one find balance in the classroom when a large percentage of students do not do the homework? Is there a way other than simply removing large chunks and failing them? Is thee a more enlightened way?</p>

11297,"<p>We are at the moment designing a document which we can hand out to Bachelor and Master students to give them a general idea on how to efficiently write a thesis. We also do this to make correcting easier for us. We are working in the field of cell biology. A thesis in our field is usually structured like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Abstract</li>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Materals and Methods</li>
<li>Results</li>
<li>Discussion</li>
<li>Acknowledgements</li>

<p>What we've come up so far is the following list of best practices. This is based on our experiences with previous students and our own theses.</p>

<ol>
<li>You can already start writing your materials and methods (M&amp;M) section during your regular lab schedule. This will save you time later on.</li>
<li>You will have discussions with your supervisors on your results, in which you will decide on what to include in your thesis.</li>
<li>Start by making the figures for your results and a corresponding caption.
Lay out bullet points of your results. Afterwards, start writing the text around these bullet points. After finishing, send this part to your supervisor for proofreading.</li>
<li>Proceed with the discussion. Again, lay out bullet points, but this time, before writing, clarify each point with your supervisor. This will prevent you from having to rewrite large parts.</li>
<li>Continue with the introduction and, if you haven’t written it yet, M&amp;M.
The introduction should contain everything the reader has to know in order to understand why you did what you did and what the results mean. Be brief and clear.</li>
<li>Finalize by writing an abstract (“Zusammenfassung”). This has to be written and edited very carefully because it will be the part most people read. Your thesis also needs to include an english abstract which is an exact translation of the german one. </li>
<li>Don’t forget the acknowledgements (“Danksagung”). This is the second part everyone will read, and it’s extremely unpolite if you don’t have one. It doesn’t have to be formal and can be personal.</li>

I plan on applying to graduate school, but I have not yet taken the GRE exams, and there a few key courses (Topology and Algebra in particular) that I have not taken yet, so I am hesitant to take the Advanced Math GRE too soon. (If you're wondering why I haven't taken Topology and Algebra yet, it's because I was trying to secure a CS degree, which sidetracked my mathematical studies last year. It was a healthy branching out experience, and one that helped me realize my true academic passion.)</p>

<p>My main question: <em>what is the perception of students who take a gap year between their graduation and starting graduate school?</em></p>

<p>I think I will take the GRE tests this fall, a) for practice and b) if I score high, then I might as well apply sooner rather than later. However, I ask this question to gauge how much energy I should put into preparing for the tests this fall. If I hear, ""You should really do your best to avoid any gap in your education,"" then I will work my butt off in preparation for the tests. But if I hear, ""It's totally okay take a gap year before going into graduate school,"" then I would give myself more freedom in terms of my non-standardized-exam studies, extracurriculars, and in general social activities. I figure the answer to this question won't be as cut-and-dry as I hope, but any advice would be appreciated!</p>

<p>I'm a fast learner for most topics. I already have programming experience, so that half of the class was no challenge. The mathematical concepts I grasped quickly, and as a result most of the lectures were too slow for me.  This isn't anything new for me, I often have this issue. </p>

<p>The bulk of the homework problems given were standard book problems and had no real significance or relation to the application of these methods. There were one or two problems that were applied and those were great, but to be honest I have a problem doing homework and have had it for around 20 years now (since grade school). I understand the importance of it, it's rarely (if ever) difficult for me, but it bores me and I have no motivation to do it. It doesn't help that now I work full time with a wife and 1.5 children, so there is a small window in which I even have to fit this homework.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks into the course I thought perhaps if the homework was more interesting somehow (puzzle-like, application problems (aka story problems), etc) then that would be better for me, but I didn't know how to approach the professor about this. Long story short the bulk of the grading is homework and I'm not doing as well as I could be. It's likely too late for this class, but how would I approach this in the future? It'd be torture to have to continue down this road.</p>

11377,"<p>I'm a postdoc and a guy who used to be a part of our group dropped by today and said repeatedly that he wanted to collaborate with me and that he's too busy with other commitments to do any work. I suggested a project where he could write up some of his recent experiences in the area (I know of a publication that did something similar to this that we could use as a framework and am working with another man in our group on this), and he had no interest in that saying instead he was more interested in the data analysis I'm doing.  </p>

<p>The message I got was ""I don't have time to do anything, but I want to be a co-author"".
He was ""generous"" enough to say he ""doesn't need to be the first or second author"".</p>

<p>How would you handle that?</p>

<p>During my PhD I had one of my supervisor's former students do this to me. He got 3 publications out of me, which he didn't understand well enough to present at a conference (he insisted that I create slides for him and write a word-for-word script for him to deliver - the conference was in his area of the world).  I eventually put my foot down and refused to have him as a co-author again (my supervisor was pushing to put his name on a 4th publication, I think she wanted to help him get tenure and / or was repaying some debt to him with my work).</p>

<p>I don't want to spend time trying to defend my work from people who didn't contribute putting their names on it, but I'm not sure the best way to get rid of him. My PI thinks quite highly of him.</p>

<p>I'm going out with my PI casually for dinner tomorrow and am planning to bring this up and ask him to be explicit about his authorship policy (my PI reserves the right to determine authorship of work from our lab).  I don't want to seem whiny, but also don't want to spend time / energy worrying about this.</p>

<p>Am I overly anxious about this?  Maybe it doesn't really matter as long as I'm the first author?  If that's the case, I'm tempted to just put everyone I know on it (I don't want to reward this guy for being obnoxious).</p>

11412,"<p>I'm trying to choose the best university in the UK for a computer science master's course, leaning in a more theoretical direction. But sites like <a href=""http://www.prospects.ac.uk/search_courses.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">prospects.ac.uk</a> are too broad, I don't want to filter 350 results which consist of basically the same buzzwordy text about carreer opportunities manually.</p>

<p>My current approach is checking out universities I've heard of in the field, trying to find the actual course listing and guessing from that the actual direction teaching might take (currently Glasgow is my first choice because it's the only one to list a ""functional programming"" course, which is at least a first step into the direction I want); but even the course descriptions in the listing are quite fuzzy…</p>

<p>The problem of looking at publications from areas I would like to work in and choosing a university from that (hoping that a master's there might set me on a PhD route) is that, at least in undergrad studies, there's little connection between the researcher's work and teaching. But I haven't nailed down an exact direction to go in either, so directly finding research groups I'm interested in and working backwards from there would be hard, too, since there would probably be more than 350 of those as well.</p>

11416,"<p>Here is my situation, I'm about to graduate with a Ph.D. within the next few months.  My dissertation is done, so I can dedicate quite a bit of time to the issue I'm describing. </p>

<p>At the moment, I have never taught a college level course.  For the entire length of my program I've been on the research side.  I'm very frustrated by this, as ""teaching"" was always my personal number 2 choice after graduation (number 1 is not in academia, a long shot and not relevant to this conversation).  (And just to remove those suggesting that I should have asked to teach, I have -- for years -- but that's water under the bridge as they say)</p>

<p>Due to this lack of teaching, I've done everything I could think of: I've taught mini classes to staff and my cohort on specific topics (e.g. LaTeX), and when available, I've taught at university programs for high schoolers.  And, I've recently, applied to every community college in a two hour radius (our university is in the sticks, so that isn't actually very many), to try to get an adjunct job.  </p>

<p>But my fear is that the community colleges won't care about my research or other experience -- they will just note that I don't have teaching experience, so I won't get those positions either -- which means I'll graduate without ever <em>really</em> teaching.   </p>

11441,"<p>I just received the galley proofs for an article which has been accepted to a well-regarded math journal.</p>

<p>The copyediting is, quite frankly, terrible. The copyeditor has introduced dozens of mathematical, typographical, and bibliographic mistakes. The proofs were accompanied by a list of changes and questions, and some of the newly introduced mistakes were described in this list, but not all. </p>

<p>A few representative examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The editor has, in many places, replaced the mathematical notation &lt;&lt; with ""is much less than"". It is universal within my subfield of mathematics that &lt;&lt; means something very different from ""is much less than"".</p></li>
<li><p>The editor has typeset fractions in different ways, so that what was formerly in the denominator is now in the numerator.</p></li>
<li><p>The editor has monkeyed unacceptably with the bibliography. I used a software package, for which I looked up on their FAQ how to cite it. The editor replaced my correct bibliography entry with something different.</p></li>
<li><p>The tables now appear in wrong places. A cursory reading of the edited text reveals that it now makes no sense, and this would be obvious even to someone without specialized knowledge of my field.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on and on, but I don't want to just rant. Instead I have two closely related questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First of all, is this typical? I find it difficult to imagine that a publisher who did this kind of shoddy work on a regular basis could stay in business. I wonder if I just had the bad luck to get the new employee this time around.</p></li>
<li><p>More importantly, is a strong response warranted? I am inclined to write to the journal staff, tell them that their work is unacceptably sloppy, explain in detail why, and ask them to start over from scratch, and to furnish a list of all changes made, no matter how minor.</p>

<p>This is not just because I want to pick an argument. I have gone through my paper line-by-line several times in the past, making very sure that everything I said was correct. With this level of copyediting work, I am back to square one and I suspect I might accidentally miss several errors introduced by the copyeditors.</p>

<p>Would such an e-mail be likely to produce the kind of results I'm looking for?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thanks to everyone who replied. I wrote a strong, but I hope polite, e-mail to my contact at the journal, listing several of the mistakes, and asking them to start over and to send me a complete list of changes. His first reply was a little bit ambiguous, appearing to perhaps misunderstand what I was asking for -- but he has since apologized and agreed to my requests.</p>

<p>One point of departure from Anonymous Mathematician's advice: I haven't said anything to the editorial board and the publisher, or discussed this issue (other than here, anonymously) with anyone but my coauthor and my contact at the journal -- happily, it looks like there won't be any reason to.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> As I requested, my contact at the journal started again from scratch, did a much more conservative job of copyediting, and provided me a copy of my file which was marked up in red and blue with every change they made. Needless to say this made my job quite easy and I thanked them for their good work.</p>

11448,"<p>This is one question that probably has an archaic answer.  I recently reviewed a paper for a journal that stuck all the figures at the end (with placeholders in-text).  Where I publish, we typically provide camera-ready manuscripts or at least give reviewers a version with the figures embedded so that they can see what the heck is going on.  Occasionally, you embed the figures plus they are attached separately at the end (due to how the system generates the PDF).  However, I recognize that dumping the figures at the end of a journal submission for review is quite common in some fields.</p>

<p>My simple question: Why?</p>

<p>I assume that at some point, there was a purpose to putting figures at the end rather than where they belong.  I am also aware that it is quite common for journals to shuffle around your figure positions.  But why would journals possibly want their copy to have all the figures dumped at the end?  Obviously it is not for the reviewers' benefit, as it makes certain papers nigh-unreadable (""As you can see in Figure 1"" - <em>opens up second copy of the PDF so I can see Fig 1 at the same time as the text</em>).

The guy happens to be one of my close friend. The prof. wanted to write a journal paper based on the results of his dissertation with that candidate. This was kind of near the end of his graduation (three weeks before final defense). At that time he said that he was already stressed out about defense and will write the paper after the event as it won't take him more than a week.</p>

<p>Now he has graduated and had asked the professor about the journal paper but the professor kind of brushed it under the carpet saying he is looking for CFPs (Call for papers) where they can write and never got back to him, despite his constant enquiries.</p>

<p>For his research on human-computer interaction, I had developed apps which formed the core of his project. So my advisor asked me if I was interested in writing the paper and she convinced me that since I developed the apps (that formed basis of the research) it was fair enough that I write it. But after a week, she ignored me and wrote the paper herself and submitted it to the journal.</p>

<p>I came to know last week that my advisor wrote the paper herself and got it published . This prof , is an assistant professor trying to get tenure. I am trying to understand the motivation behind this behavior. </p>

  in June 1976. Diffie and Hellman also distributed preprints of their
  ``New Directions in Cryptography'' paper, which disclosed the
  Diffie-Hellman system, at that conference and by mail. For example,
  Mike Matyas received a copy in August 1976. The patent was filed in
  September 1977.</p>
  
  <p>Under United States case law, a document has been published if it
  ``has been disseminated or otherwise made available to the extent that
  persons interested and ordinarily skilled in the subject matter or
  art, exercising reasonable diligence, can locate it.'' A patent is
  automatically invalid if the patented invention was published more
  than a year before the patent's filing date.</p>
  
  <p>It appears, therefore, that the Diffie-Hellman-Merkle patent was
  invalid. In the subsequent court case MIT v. Fortia, another patent
  was invalidated for the same reason: the inventor handed out six
  copies of a preprint at a conference fourteen months before applying
  for the patent.</p>

<p>How does this work in the general case?  Is it important that in both examples a whole year has passed between the publishing and the patent application?</p>

<p>Is it necessary for a significant amount of time to pass between the publishing of a paper, and the patent application, for the patent to be subsequently declared invalid?</p>

<p>Specifically, if one's university explicitly claims that it has no interest in one's copyrighted work (whether books, articles or software), and no interest in any part of any revenue from such copyrights, but that patent revenue sharing and disclosure to the university of the patentable ideas is mandatory (<a href=""http://policies.iu.edu/policies/categories/administration-operations/intellectual-property/intellectual-property.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">IU</a>), <strong>can one get around of any future claims for patents by simply releasing everything open-source and publishing all pre-prints before the university's patent office can get their hand on any of the research?</strong></p>

<p>Is it appropriate for me to ask my graduate school department on their guidelines in giving out scholarships?</p>

<p>I feel like I have been cheated from scholarship because I have found out people who have worse undergrad GPA/GRE got scholarship and I didn't. I am an architecture major and will study in USC this coming Fall. I submitted my application 2 weeks before the deadline, but they emailed me that I was missing my community college transcript so they couldn't forward to the architecture department they finally forwarded my application early March. I responded to their email the next day with the transcript, but they just took their time to file it. Could that be a factor? If scholarships are given out based on performance then I really think I deserve it after, again, knowing that people who performed worse than me in undergrad received it.</p>

11645,"<p>I am a postdoc in Physics areas and trying to get myself ready for applying for tenure track positions. However, the US academic salary system seems still mysterious to me.
In several salary surveys, a reasonably close figure for starting salaries of starting assistant professor positions emerge as $75-80K per year. The point is that, as far as I understand it, the salary is based on the calender year basis. However, the contracts for the assistant professors are usually academic year basis (except that probably in the first couple of years they may get this full salary in their start up package). 
This means that practically they get $55-60K for 8-9 months. The rest of the salary, called the summer salary, needs to be obtained via applying to the respective funding agencies.</p>

<p>However, funding is obviously not guaranteed every year. So it is obviously out of question that people should be based on the full year salary amounts shown above. Truthfully, their salaries are $55-60k per calender year and if they are able to get some funding, they can get some bonus over the summer.</p>

<p>Now, the first question is: isn't it way too low of a starting salary for a PhD in STEM areas?! Especially, people are normally already in their mid 30s when they get a tenure track position so they usually have a family to support. Sure, there are many people survive with much lower salaries and also the stereotypical argument that you don't enter academia if you want to earn money is also around. But I am talking about skills, experience and qualification. Anyway, it just seems too low salary to me and I would really want to know if there is something crucial I am missing here.</p>

<p>Secondly, what do faculty members do if they don't get the summer salaries, what other options are there for them to compensate the money.</p>

11649,"<p>I am a PhD student, and have just finished the last part of my course requirement. My last assignment is to review several other student's term projects from a seminar course.</p>

<p>One of the projects I have been asked to review is rife with plagiarism. More than 75% of the paper is plagiarized, from over two dozen different sources, including academic papers, stackoverflow.com, and wikipedia. I have reported all of this to my professor, along with a detailed summary of which parts are taken from where.</p>

<p>However, some of the paper appears to be plagiarized from the student's <em>own</em> earlier assignments, in a different course. It's fairly obvious that this is the case because they first plagiarized the assignment description to summarize the problem they wanted to study, and then provide an answer to said problem, including answering discussion questions that are on the assignment, but somewhat unrelated to their main topic.</p>

<p>The <em>context</em> is peculiar (but I would like to keep it detached from the generality of the question): he's a part-time student, he's paying his own fees (as opposed to a PhD funded by a project), and he's after the PhD ""title"" more than the research that he has to put in for the title itself.</p>

<p>All these factors make it more difficult to dissuade him from his PhD choice: the endless excuses of putting more work when there will be time (he's a part time student); and the fact that I am proactively chasing him to arrange meetings are all things that are taking their toll.</p>

11655,"<p>When writing a manuscript for a scientific article, I often wonder what software I should cite or acknowledge, and how.</p>

<p>The first problem is to make a choice <strong>which</strong> software to cite. On the one hand, there is no way to cite all software, as this would mean to cite my whole software stack (Linux, GNU tools, emacs, git, ...). On the other hand, not citing any software is not fair, either. Furthermore, some software explicitly asks to be cited, some software doesn't. Also, some software is really crucial to the results, some isn't. Another important aspect is that citing software is not only about giving credit to the authors of the software, but also to give other scientists hints on what software they might want to use. So, he choice which software to cite is a problem.</p>

<p>The second problem is <strong>how</strong> to cite the software. Some (scientific) software does provide a classical scientific article that can be cited. However, in this case, no URL to the software is given. Others do not have an associated article. How do I cite these? I have seen people that cite the manual of a software, others just give the URL. What is the way to go?</p>

<p>Another aspect is <strong>where</strong> to cite the software. Some software can be cited in the course of the articles text, but when it comes to more fundamental software, other places may be more appropriate.</p>

11675,"<p>I have been reading in different forums now and searching for the advice that can give me an answer to my dilemma of quitting or continuing my PhD. In this search I did not find any entry to why I should stay in the PhD.</p>

<p><strong>Profile</strong>: Female, 29 years old. Undergraduate in Agronomy Engineering and MSc in Environmental Studies</p>

<p><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>

<p><strong>I started my PhD</strong> on political economy 14 months ago. At the beginning I did not like the topic at all. However <strong>doing a PhD has always been my dream,</strong> as I am very curious and I love learning something new everyday. So despite my lack of theoretical foundations on this discipline, I was so passionate about politics that I considered it was the gap I needed to cover on my interdisciplinary education in order to understand the state of the agriculture nowadays. </p>

<p>At the start, I was not convinced of the reputation of my host university so I decided to search for a second supervisor who was internationally well-known and recognised in the field. Then, I engaged in different theoretical courses in order to acquire the background I was lacking and started working with both my supervisors.</p>

<p><strong>After my preliminary fieldwork,</strong> I came back depressed, demotivated and wanting to quit. I realised that I did not have any other alternatives, so I started job hunting while I was giving my last change to the PhD. Steadily I brought the topic to a terrain I like more and I became a bit more enthusiastic about it. However it is not (and has never been) the topic I am passionate about. On top of that it implies the need for more fieldwork (1 year) and living in harsh situations that are not appealling anymore. Furthermore I realised that jumping into a new and so abstract discipline <strong>is representing to me a more major challenge than I initially expected and I feel that I am much slower than my other colleagues.</strong> I realised <strong>I am no longer the bright student that I used to be before</strong> and maybe I am not made to deal with the construction of knowledge that academia represents. I also started questioning the power relations in the academia and how hard and competitive it may become. I start feeling a lot of stress and <strong>lose more and more self-confidence</strong> on what and if I can do it. And finally I questioned if I really want to do a PhD? For what? What are the reasons that hamper me to quit? Why I am staying?</p>

<p><strong>DILEMMA: TO STAY OR NOT TO STAY?</strong></p>

<p><strong>The reasons why I am staying</strong> is firstly because I love research (but I hate academia). I love learning something new everyday and engaging in discussions with very interesting people. However I hate the competitiviness that academia embodies and the constant show-off it implies. It makes me feel terribly insecure and to not enjoy the learning process.
I love the people I met along the way and I adore and admire my supervisors. However the topic is not the one that makes me feel super motivated in the tough moments.</p>

<p><strong>The reasons that hamper me from quitting</strong> are the compromise I felt I have acquired with my both supervisors. The amount of money and time they have invested in me makes me feel I owe them to finish... Additionally both of them are very recognised people in the field, so in case I would decide to quit this PhD and change into another one where my passion is... I wonder what my credibility as an scholar would be if I keep changing without completing things. </p>

<p>So I asked constantly since a long time ago: <strong>whether or not I want to do a PhD?</strong> I get to the conclusion I can work in research in many other places (i.e. think tanks, international organisations) that even if, and most likely, might be also competitive and with power relations involved, I don't have to deal with the theoretical issues that are killing me now. I realised that I am more an action, hands-on person that search for solutions to problems and don't like so much revolving around a problem for so looooooong (which is one of the things why I can not find the passion in my topic). I realised that I don't need a PhD for doing so and that the labour market can not absorb so many Doctors.</p>

<p>So having reflected on what I would like to do in my life (which I can not now see how it will be in academia), <strong>my fears about quitting the PhD are</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I don't have alternatives now. I searched for them but I see it is incompatible to be job hunting while trying to make sense of my PhD (in terms of emotions and time).</p></li>
<li><p>I am scared of regretting quitting the academia and not being able to work in research in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't know if I can stand the disappointment of my supervisors for quitting.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't want to lose contact with the wonderful people I met along the way.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And <strong>why do I want to quit</strong>?</p>

<p>I am fed up of theory. I am not good at engaging with it and I don't understand it. This is stressing me incredibly and is becoming a very painful process.
I don't want to defend myself in everything I elaborate putting all my intellectual effort, because someone else may find many things in my work to criticise.
I am not passionate about the topic.
I don't want to go back either to the fieldwork or to my host university.
I feel I have many other skills that are hidden in academia. However when I develop those skills I feel much happier (like social skills).</p>

<p>So what shall I do? I would appreciate any advice (apologies if I did spelling mistakes but I am not a native english speaker)</p>

11710,"<p>I am currently in the process of applying for PhDs. My question is whether it is frowned upon to have done a degree in a subject completely unrelated to my main studies. I just completed two masters at top universities concurrently, one in biology and the other in English literature. I did the literature degree to please my parents, my real passion is in biology. I steered my English degree somewhat towards the biology by writing my dissertation on the representation of tropical diseases in literature. I am wondering whether I should list this degree on my CV or just leave it off? I thought that it might prove how hard-working I am to do two masters concurrently. I also scored the highest mark out of my class in my biology master, so the other master did not affect my primary  master.</p>

<li>Currently, we have funding to hire them only for the initial stages.

<p>I have got to ask a slightly different question:  I have a past supervisor while I did my masters and she wasn't really involved or as active as I would have liked. Also, I received no funding from this professor. I did however receive a scholarship from the university to fund my masters; not sure if these facts change anything.  Naturally, this person would also like to believe she was involved, so had I finished the research while I did my masters there I would have listed this individual as a second author and even the author of correspondence.  But now I am pursuing a PhD and in fact in a  slightly different field at a different university.</p>

<p>While preparing for my qualifiers I came across some fresh new ideas and had a light bulb moment.  Consequently, I have made significant progress in my old project as of late.  I believe by the end of the summer I will have results ready for publication.  On the one hand, I feel I should notify my old professor of these results once they come in... I think it would be wrong or even unethical to let them find out through the grape-vine or just through reading to keep up with the field.  On the other hand, I fear this person will want authorship or even write the editor and demand it; this person is a Reader at a prestigious university while I'm just a little PhD student.  I feel it will be a case of he-said she-said with the Editor which will ultimately result in me losing (even though I completely believe I'm justified and the recent progress was 100% mine).  </p>

My BS is in CIS where the focus was real world application and lots of management type stuff, so there wasn't much math and I know that is going to be be a problem. I was looking at ASU's MSE program which implied that the only pre-requisite was Calc I. However, when I was looking through the pre-reqs for each individual class, there were things like Intro to Embedded systems and such; subjects that were obviously not included in CIS. I currently work as a Software Engineer, but our focus is pretty level in that it's typical information systems type stuff (just moving data in and out of databases).

11740,"<p>I am a first-year PhD student in Biology and I am currently working in a lab for a very hard-to-please PI (a new PI who started a couple years ago and only just recruited her first few graduate students). I am very interested and excited about this line of research and I really want to do what I am doing. But my PI's way of managing people makes everyone miserable and I am not sure what to do.</p>

<p>Background: Last fall, I rotated in a lab which I really enjoyed working in and generated some great data, but had to leave, along with the other rotation student, because PI had no funding. In the spring, I rotated with a brand new PI, whose lab I helped set up and started on a project, but did not stay in his lab because his management was very poor - was never around, didn't know or care what was going on with projects, etc, and I was also advised to join a different lab by the academic coordinator who said they thought this PI was not ""ready"" to handle a graduate student. So then, I started a THIRD rotation in another ""new"" PI's lab and have been here for three months. </p>

<p>This person's research is really great, but their management seems to focus heavily on threatening language and negative reinforcement. They often send very angry emails to the lab. When this person is feeling ""iffy"" about you because you didn't get fantastic results or you responded to an email too slowly, they will tell you to your face that you are not worth their time to mentor if you don't ""try harder."" I recently gave PI a sequence alignment, but accidentally gave them the wrong version of the sequence, and as a result, they said they would not be willing to fund me as an RA. PI actually made the same mistake when they did the sequence comparison (which is OKAY! It is an easy mistake to make!), but they were just so harsh on me for the mistake. All their communication with me makes me feel that, despite my good merits, progress or improvements, they disapprove of me or are angry with me. They deal with my labmates in the same way and my labmates have often expressed their worries and stresses to me over this. I should note that some of my labmates are well-accomplished, highly dedicated post-doctoral researchers who devote ALL of their time and efforts to their work. The dynamic in the lab overall is not very good, in part because people feel increased anxiety from the PI's anger or lack of professionalism in expressing themself. It is really a huge distraction from my work whenever PI is talking about kicking me out of the lab. I go from focused on an experiment to panicking about what to do or who I should talk to. </p>

<p>I still respect this person as a scientist, but I feel at times that this harsh style of management/dealing with people is too much for me. I am not perfect, but I am trying very hard and have made so much progress on my work, I just wish PI would recognize this. Almost in my second year of graduate school, and with the school potentially not able to support me with a TA in the future, and with me working in my third lab, I am extremely stressed out by this situation. I feel that, if I do not make it work in this miserable lab, I will be kicked out of the school and then lose my chance to earn a PhD.</p>

<p>Let me describe my situation (it is quite specific, but it can be generalized):</p>

<ul>
<li>I have completed PhD in Russia (at some provincial university, on knowledge representation and high-performance computing) which I am unfortunately not quite happy with (it could be better and I did it during my work at a company).</li>
<li>I have some publications, but none in top journals/conferences.</li>
<li>I have very diverse interests that span machine learning, knowledge representation, AI, algorithms, parallel programming, performance analysis, etc. I am trying to stick myself to just one direction: scalability problems of machine learning of big data sets, but well, there are so many interesting topics! :-) I visit summer schools on these diverse topics.</li>
<li>I live in Russia (province, so to say) and I still do some teaching and research advise in local university, but I am not a faculty staff and I refused to be one. The reason is that it only involves teaching, but I want to do research. Also, faculty members at Russia have extremely low salary that will not allow me to survive. But there is one group doing research in machine learning there (not a famous one by all means).</li>
<li>At the moment I am a software development engineer (in one of the top companies) doing research-like work in high-performance computing, but which is very applied. It is not always possible to publish a paper for the outcomes of this work, that's why it is not completely scientific/research. Also there are some software development tasks (previously I did it a lot, ~10 years).</li>
<li>I have a family (wife + son of 8 years + plan to have another baby in some future).</li>
<li>At the moment I am trying to do research work during my free time as much as I can, but it is not always very effective of course, because it is not my job. But I am trying to use every minute for this. </li>
</ul>

<p>My goal: do scientific research. I believe that it is not very effective to do it as a hobby, so I am searching for a way to have a scientific position. I am ready to give a lot for it; I will be happy to have a medium salary, enough to support my family.</p>

<p>Possible ways to meet this goal:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Europe/US and do a PhD there. Not possible, because I already have a PhD and I won't be able to support my family.</li>
<li>Go to Europe/US and do postdoc work. Somewhat possible, but:
<ul>
<li>Need to produce at least 2 good publications first.</li>
<li>Will I be able to support my family?</li>
<li>Postdocs are temporary positions. This could mean switching countries and it could be difficult for my son at school (due to language).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Join research group at local university. I am going to do this, but it is temporary, I wanted to work with top people in this field. But it's good for the start.</li>
<li>Join some research lab or faculty in university in Europe/US. Well, that's a dream, but I need to be more prepared for this.</li>
</ol>

<p>My current plan is to do 3), do research and write papers on my own or with this group and then... I'll see. Though, doing research and writing papers on one's own is quite difficult, because you don't know what is important.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mastery is more important than passing grades. You will reach limits
  in learning when you have a ""Swiss cheese"" foundation full of
  misconception holes. Master each concept before building on top.

My questions is as follows: I graduated about a year ago with a Master's in Applied Physics from a reputable university. I've been a B student throughout my academic career and I feel like I started building on un-mastered concepts somewhere towards the end of <em>high school</em>. Despite obtaining a relatively <em>tough</em> engineering degree, I cut corners whenever possible. If I could pass an exam by being able to do all the exercises, I would get to that level and stop there. I would rarely - if ever - go for complete mastery. As a result I feel like I have Swiss cheese holes in my understanding that date back to high school. </p>

<p>If Albert Einstein's quote is anything to go by: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.</p>

<li>Why can you express a wave as an imaginary exponential? </li>
<li>How does a photon have momentum, but not mass?</li>
<li>What is the intuitive understanding of eigenfunctions, eigenvalues and their physical manifestations?</li>

<p>When it came time to put my CV together, I said to myself, screw the normal order.  Everyone has a PhD applying for a given job, why should that be first?  So my order was:</p>

<ul>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Research</li>
<li>Teaching</li>
<li>Presentations</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Everything Else</li>
</ul>

<p>I went and talked to a committee member who is more of a friend than anything else, he thought it was strange, but probably good.  My chair thought it was fantastic idea.  Then I spoke to another committee member, she thought it was just wrong -- and she has been on many search committees.</p>

<p>Not only just wrong, but deserving of no more than a bullet point under ""industry experience"", she compared it to working for a company (like working for a company and <em>running a company</em> are the same thing).</p>

<p>Now, I have a huge amount of respect for all three of these people (I'm unusual in that I actually like my committee).  However, what I think happened is that the first two people understand what my company does.  They get that product development is really hard and is very similar to research (and in fact harder than research in some cases).  And a huge reason that I've been a productive researcher is because of the skills that I gained from the business (not to mention the ""real world"" perspective).  However, when I explained that to the third person, she didn't buy any of that.  And I think it is quite possible her reaction is more representative of someone who doesn't know me.</p>

<p>I get that the most important thing is research (and I have more research than most of my cohort, so I'm not suggesting this is a substitute).  But people list absurd things on their CV.  They list their community service (which I have as well, I just don't list it).  Or not real awards (like travel grants).  In fact, in this same conversation she suggested I list some extremely minor volunteer work for a grant she applied for.  Certainly, the thousands of hours of work involved in my business has to be worth a lot more than that!</p>

<p>So this is my current thoughts.  I list the ""standard"" order, but I still have a good half page on my business, albeit on page 5 of the CV.  Thoughts?  Does this really not matter at all?  </p>

11812,"<p>I did my undergraduate degree in the US and am heading to graduate school here in less than a month, so I myself have taken the Graduate Record Examinations (the general as well as two subjects tests) and I guess it always just seemed as a sort of un-avoidable formality that nothing could be done about, and so I just took it and got it over with.</p>

<p>In the intervening year between undergrad and the start of my Ph.D. work, however, I traveled overseas to Cambridge where I found that I was quite mistaken:  the GRE is very, very avoidable.  The solution is simple:  don't apply to universities in the US.</p>

<p>By the time I had arrived there, I had already gotten it over with myself, but for most of my peers there, this was not the case, and quite a few of them had simply decided to not even bother applying to the US because of the inconvenience that comes along with that in the form of the GRE.</p>

<p>This made me wonder:  are admissions committees at US universities aware of the number of highly qualified candidates they miss out on because of the GRE?</p>

<p>I could understand being willing to miss out on the potential recruitment of these students if the GRE were a significant part of one's application, but I have yet to find any US professor tell me that the GRE scores are weighted highly when it comes to making admissions decisions (perhaps I just haven't asked around enough?).  In fact, I've often been told it's the <em>least important</em> factor when deciding whether someone should be admitted.  (Indeed, my impression is that the general GRE is more or less a joke and only serves as a convenient way of tossing out applicants who would have been found un-qualified for other reasons.)</p>

<p>Putting aside for a moment the issue of those who decide not to apply to US universities, let's consider the inconvenience faced by those who do.  Once again, if you're from the US, I can imagine simply not being aware of this (I know I wasn't), but I now know of several people who have <em>had to fly</em> (sometimes the flights have even been inter-continental!) in order to sit to take a GRE test.  And even for those who don't (like probably most of us in the US), there is the ridiculous price:  almost $200 for the general and an extra $150 per subject test. I was under the impression that admissions committees encourage people from all backgrounds to apply, rich or poor, but how can they honestly expect this to happen if even those who don't have to fly have to shell out anywhere from $300-$500 in addition to the application fee? (I personally find it a bit nuts that these tests cost several times more than the application itself.)</p>

<p>So, could somebody please explain to me why we still require students to take these things? Do they really add information about the applicant and their abilities that could not be found out any other way?</p>

12033,"<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> I think my supervisor has a severe lack of knowledge, does too many things instead of focusing heavily on just a few things and hence I can't really focus on my research project.</p>

<p><strong>Long Story</strong> I started my PhD a few months back and was hired specifically to work on a certain project. We have a few very outstanding research groups as collaborating teams but all in different research areas. </p>

<p>After a few weeks into my PhD, I was hit by all the different side projects my supervisor tries to kick off. They are extremely time consuming and not research related at all. Besides, I noticed that my supervisor has a severe lack of knowledge in one of our core research areas. As a consequence, I can't discuss any of my ideas with him. As the other PhD students feel the same way, we have mentioned the lack of time quite a few times in our group meetings. And although he agreed that we need more time on proper research, things didn't really change yet. As a consequence, my motivation for the project starts to decline, although I continue to be extremely passionate about the project's overall goals!</p>

I am ahead of schedule and almost done with my thesis.I am good at programming and completed the project in 3 weeks (my professor thought it would take at least 3 months). Now, my professor is asking me to work on other things which involve developing apps for her other projects. I have protested by saying I am an GRA and I should only be concerned with my thesis project and my work in all other large projects in the lab should be at my discretion.</p>

<p>My advisor replied that I am pretty lucky to work for her since other professors have graduate students who work on 5 projects simultaneously (which of course is load of crap, I have other friends working in other labs who only work on their thesis). The other time I protested, my advisor said that since I am supposed to work 40 hours a week in lab, the project should be completed within 2 weeks easily. (These projects which my advisor wants me to do require some 80 hours of programming sometimes since I first need to learn the language and then write code for it). It's not that I don't want to develop apps, but I am more interested in writing journal papers for IEEE with deadlines in November, and I need all the time I can for that endeavor. I raised this issue but my advisor said that getting accepted in IEEE is remote, so I should concentrate on writing apps since there is a very good chance for her to get funded if I develop them.</p>

<p>I know that even if I refuse development, my advisor might throw a fit but my GRA will be intact because no advisor fires a student who is about to complete thesis. Also, I had asked my advisor if she would be interested in helping me with getting a PhD after thesis and she flatly said no. The advisor said I should probably go back to industry and work for 3-4 years and then decide on PhD. It seemed more like an excuse to make me get out of the lab. So it's pretty obvious there is no chance of a long-term relationship with my advisor.</p>

12050,"<p>I am required to complete 300 practicum hours to fulfill my requirements in a Masters program.  I decided to fulfill these hours by creating a practicum experience with my GRA (graduate research assistant) supervisor.  This experience was designed for me to develop skills in tasks that I would not normally do in my GRA.  We decided to work on a few different projects- I was to submit an letter of intent after taking a course on grant writing, help develop a couple of publications in the works, and work on a presentation for our group.  </p>

<p>I took the grant writing course, developed some general ideas with my supervisor on paths that we might pursue, and we submitted the grant.  I was told that I would take the lead on this grant as part of my experience.  And I have for the most part.  We did a lot of editing together, we met with the grant coordinator of our school, and I did most of the research for the grant.  It was a continuation of an earlier project, but the application was novel and it was something that I created and took ownership over.  I was excited as this was my first grant and I worked very hard on it.  I wanted this to happen.</p>

<p>Months go by and we are working on the other parts of the practicum, mostly working on some publication work.  But it felt like I was being excluded from the main discussion and I was not receiving much support.  It is an area that is not in my background, but I wanted to get experience in this area.  It felt like I was wasting hours sitting there with no support, so I did not count my hours towards the practicum.  I would try to get her to help, but it always seemed like I was bothering her or she didn't have time or was frustrated.  When I told her that I have not counted my hours recently, that I was just doing GRA hours, she seemed frustrated and told me that I need to get this over with.  I didn't think I was getting enough out of the experience.  At this point I started regretting doing my practicum experience here because I would have had a chance to develop real skills elsewhere.  Then, I thought that I probably should have been given more tasks in my GRA hours.  I was horribly underworked to begin with, and my practicum was an attempt to gain more meaningful experiences out of this group.  </p>

<p>Recently, we get the word back that the letter of intent was accepted and there was a very good chance that we would get the grant.  I reply back to the grant coordinator like I had done before, since I was taking the lead on this grant, and instead, my supervisor gets in and starts coordinating things.  I keep trying to set up meetings and figure out the next step, but she took over the project.  No discussion, no email at all.  Now there is a lot of work going on with this grant and I feel excluded.  She has not assigned me a task to work on for this and I have not heard anything.  I feel like I am left in the dark.  I know she has a lot more experience and skill with these things, but this feels like it would be a big opportunity for me.  To be honest, I would like some recognition from department.  I feel like I helped the department score funds with a practicum and grant idea that was mine.  I feel pushed away on both the grants and the publications.  </p>

<p>Can you think of a way to approach this?  I really do like her and I don't want to cause any issues.  I just think she is a poor leader and supervisor.  I viewed it as a team effort to begin with and I was hoping to continue this way, but it does not feel like it is going this direction.      </p>

It's the closest thing I have to a contract actually.</p>

<p>Theoretically the concept is great, there's a formal demand to plan and revise the projects, so that things dont get out of hand. The study plan typically defines:</p>

<ul>
<li>the nature and title of graduate studies</li>
<li>an expected time of dissertation</li>
<li>the responsibilities the student has towards the department (teaching, lab/IT responsibilities etc) </li>
<li>the extent of research/course ratio per semester</li>
<li>courses taken/planned</li>
<li>the project that planned to/will be a part of the thesis</li>
</ul>

<p>Then comes a series of so-called <em>""lärandemål""</em> which I could possibly translate as ""learning goals"" mandated/advised by the board of higher education services (<em>Högskoleverket</em>) and what is planned/completed to achieve these goals. This piece constitutes a majority of the study plan essentially.</p>

<p>So far so good... I think conceptually it's a great idea. In practice, the part regarding learning goals becomes a whole bunch of formal gibberish that does not reflect reality but looks fancy on paper. My supervisor does not really care much about the plan, at least not in the format it's forced on both of us. I am not sure if this is the impostor syndrome speaking, but I feel like it's essentially an annoying piece of paperwork, on which I am forced to write what I am doing/have done in rather exaggerated fluffy words. I have also considered the possibility that I <em>perceive</em> it thus because even though I am very fluent, Swedish is not my first language. I could not say for sure... </p>

<p>I am asking this question because I have seen many math papers in arxiv.org that have not made new contribution to the field. In other words, those papers have not made new discoveries or solutions of the unsolved problems. This makes me wonder whether publishing at arxiv is considered a big achievement.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> 
In thesis writing, hypothesis is claimed to be one of the most important aspects. I'm not arguing with that but in some cases, it seems a little over-priced. I am currently writing a thesis that deals with enhancing an existing security model. I can't give out the exact idea obviously but please let me explain with the help of an example. </p>

<p>Let's say, I have a security problem that the existing ""role-based access control"" of MS-Windows does not solve some problems -- so, I come up with time-based constraints for the model used and incorporate them in a new ""enhanced"" model. In the thesis explaining this contribution, what do I write in the thesis? I can't claim an ""N%"" increase in security or any other statistic that I can think of. </p>

<p>The situation I've found myself in is the following. I have been employed as a teaching assistant at one of the top Polish universities for a year now.

12277,"<p>I'm asking what to expect after violence in my classroom, will I be fired, expelled?  What is the procedure?</p>

<p>Hopefully this is the correct stack exchange for this, if not feel free to tell me where to move it where it would be more appropriate.</p>

<p>So I am a teaching assistant and masters student in the math dept. at a large state university.  I was holding a discussion section this morning for the class I'm teaching and near the beginning some young man walks in with his shirt off acting verbally belligerent, he then comes up to the front of the room and just kind of stands there, not saying anything just kind of smiling in this creepy way and showing absolutely no signs of embarrassment or anything.  After asking the class if anyone knew him (no one did), I told him he could either leave right now or I would get someone to remove him.  I'm a small guy and he wasn't huge but he was certainly bigger than me.</p>

<p>He didn't leave upon request so I stepped out of the room to go get someone, although in retrospect I had no idea at the time who I would have gotten, but then as soon as I stepped out I realized that that probably wasn't a good idea since he could take my stuff or who knows what.  So I walked back in and sure enough he's got my water bottle in his hand, so I grab it from him and say something to the effect of,</p>

<p>""!@#$ it, does anyone big want to help me get this guy out of class?""</p>

<p>And two guys stand up, and one of them is clearly super pissed at this guy disrupting class and goes straight over to the guy and BAM hits him in the face super hard and he goes down and then hits him again and then kicks him in the face all in the span of like 5 or 6 seconds, like a proper #$!%ing beat down, and there are girls screaming and I'm a bit in shock as I was expecting him to just kind of strong arm him out of the class, and one girl comes up and is like</p>

<p>""stop hitting him stop hitting him!"" </p>

<p>and I don't exactly remember what happens right after but the guy who was disrupting must have left, and then somehow the assistant dean is like right there and I step outside and talk to her and explain quickly what happened but I don't say that the student hit the guy I just say he got him out of class, and she says later I will need to file a report, and then basically I hold the class which goes fine.</p>

<p>And then at the end of class I ask the student who hit the guy to wait for me so I can explain what the assistant dean said to me, and after dealing with other students who need something, I'm about to talk to him when the assistant dean comes back in.  And basically I ask the assistant dean if she could step outside for a little bit while I talk to this student in private, since I'm not trying to incriminate him since I feel partially responsible since I asked for help and he did get the guy out.  Well she gets super offended at this and tells me that ""I shoo you, you don't shoo me, get this straight I'm your superior"", and so I apologize but I think maybe the look on my face isn't sufficiently contrite and I look rather taken aback at her strong response.  So she writes down my name.</p>

<p>So no one not my professor/student-teacher liaison, not my ombudsman, seems to know what I should expect from all this.  I talked to the police and they did apprehend someone fitting the guys description, so I probably don't need to worry about that guy coming back.  I am however morally conflicted about having to write a report to the dean's office or whoever I have to write it to, since I don't want to get the student in trouble, since he helped me when I requested it, although I certainly didn't expect him to start beating the guy up, I thought he would just strong arm him out or something.</p>

<p>I scheduled a meeting with the dean for a week from today (earliest availability), and now I'm super worried that I'm going to be fired or kicked out of my masters program.  If I'm fired then whatever that's the way things go, but if I'm kicked out of the masters program that will completely screw up my life.  Like I said no one (not my fellow TAs, not my professor/student-liaison, not my ombudsman) seems to know what to expect from all this, and if I should be worried about getting fired or kicked out of the program. Thus I'm turning to people here who maybe know what I should expect from all this.</p>

<p><strong>~~Update~~</strong></p>

<p>So I met with the assistant dean today since I had to turn in a full written report by tomorrow morning.  She was pretty upset and clearly doesn't like me and all in all it was a pretty awful experience.  She says there's a possibility of a lawsuit and that I might be fired and she took every opportunity pretty much to try and make me feel bad and cut me down.  </p>

<p>However it didn't seem like I need to worry too much about being expelled or anything to do with my status as a masters student, which was what I was really worried about anyways.  Honestly I'm not sure I'm up to dealing with a sword of Damocles hanging over my head and may just say !@#$ it and quit, and then I just have to worry about classes.  I do have a union which I'll probably talk to first and I might see a couple more higher ups just to get some different perspectives on things.</p>

<p><strong>~~Update #2~~</strong></p>

<p>I found out that the guy who was disrupting class got arrested later that day and he was not a student.  I also talked to several students who said that this is not the first time he has done this, and that several weeks ago in another class he walked in and lit a cigarette, and the professor took the cigarette out of his mouth, stomped on it, and then physically threw him out of class.</p>

12297,"<p>I have found that while many have some appreciation of the level of research in a PhD (usually by saying ""that's way over my head"" or something similar) and I have not really had a problem with <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/257/how-do-i-not-get-impatient-when-other-people-ask-me-to-describe-my-research"">getting impatient describing my research</a>.</p>

<p>Edit to add: this is reflective of my own experience, mostly studying/researching part time and working full time in an unrelated field.</p>

<p>The query here is how to convince people of the time required for completion of the PhD, and the continued dedication needed in order to get the intrinsic tasks complete.  In some cases, it is not 'a 1000 word book report'.</p>

<p>For example, my PhD (now just submitted) was highly experimental, each set of observations were 3 hours each, and I had to do about 100-120 of them (usually on weekends as I work full time). After which, I would have to do 6-12 hours of coding/data analysis.  So many did not seem to understand that time was required to do the work properly - and were perplexed when I tried to explain.  </p>

<p>Edit to explain why I felt the need to explain, this reason I would imagine is true for many - friends and family, people that you respect, may wonder why am I seem to be ignoring them, why am I 'obsessing' over this project, why did I decline the invitation to wherever.  They may worry that we are 'hiding' behind the study.  They question why we spend so much time on our research, often not due to any jealousy, but not understanding the time commitment needed for research.</p>

<p>I am <strong>not</strong> after opinions, but are asking what are some strategies that can help educate people of the time required to perform PhD research, particularly for part time PhD students working in an unrelated field?</p>

The work does not change the basic premise of the paper, but rather expounds upon it and adds new applied programming concepts that have broader implications for the field.

12342,"<p>I am a final year PhD in UK in a scientific discipline and I am writing my thesis. I have already published 2 journal papers and I have submitted 2 more papers for publications. My department does not allow a ""publications-based"" thesis so I need to write a thesis in the context of a book etc. </p>

<p>As I write my thesis in a couple of places, especially in the literature review, I tend to reuse sentences from my publications. I try to restate them a bit, maybe change some words for their synonyms etc. but it is practically me writing about what I wrote before. It goes without saying that I cite/quote me at the end of a passage if I say something non-obvious (I found that slightly funny. :) ). The problem is that occasionally I am just explaining for instance how a certain estimation technique works; in that case I cite the original authors and not myself. The syntax in those occasions though is practically the same as the original passage I used in my publication; as I have explained it once and was consider good, I find no reason to reinvent myself (I do a mild rewording as I mentioned but that is quite insignificant). Same things goes for listings. I do cite my paper in the beginning of a big list as the list's source but the list itself is almost identical as the one in ""my"" paper; in those cases I don't use quotations, just attribution ""[]"".</p>

<p>Is there an obvious guideline? The basic definition of plagiarism ""<em>reproducing the work of another person's as your own</em>"" is not (directly) applicable to me because I am the other person (almost *); if I am using other people's work I do cite them but I don't cite myself, citing them, in quotation marks!</p>

12372,"<p>When recruiting a student or post-doc to join my group, I trim down the list of applicants to a few names (3–5) by looking at CV's, research/teaching statements, existing publications, etc. Then, I will write to the mentors/professors/teachers/PhD advisors they listed in their list of references. I will also write to people who would be obvious choice as a reference, but aren't listed (fresh PhD who doesn't list his advisor, e.g.).</p>

<p>But <strong>what do I ask these people?</strong> My “standard” email would be something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A former PhD student in your research group, Dr XXX, is applying for a position in my group. I wonder if you can give me a frank and confidential appraisal of his abilities and working style. How efficient is he, how quickly does he get things done? Is he able to communicate clearly, both in writing and orally, at a level you would expect from an good researcher? Does he interact well with other scientists, and work in a team?</p>

<p>At least one senior professor whom I sent such an email replied with a rather negative tone, saying <em>“Dr. XXX is a good scientist.

12374,"<p>I have been working at an internship this past summer, and have applied a relatively standard technique (formal analysis of a security protocol) to a new (company internal) protocol. The company are pushing me to try and get the analysis published in an academic journal. The results do not highlight anything of particular note (a few caveats and gotchas but nothing with substantial security implications), but simply provide a rigorous mathematical underpinning for their security assertions. </p>

<p>Is this something publishable? I feel it isn't because the only new bit is the protocol which was simply given to me (and is being published in its own right). If not how do I make the results of the analysis available? Obviously the analysis needs to be made public and peer review is vital (because otherwise nobody would trust the security claims). Do I just put it on the company website and hope people in the know stumble across it? Can I email appropriate people and hope they look at it?</p>

12380,"<p>Is the following common? An editor for a journal sends a paper out to, say, three or four referees. After getting the first two referee reports, the editor makes a decision and tells the third and fourth referees not to bother (so that they have potentially been wasting their time).</p>

<p>I can see this happening in some circumstances, e.g. if one referee finds a substantial error. However, I was asked to referee for one journal, and I get the impression (<em>which I have not yet confirmed</em>) that they typically send the paper out to lots of referees and take only the first couple of referee reports.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Many writers are torn between whether <strong><em>they should write the paper
  in the active or passive voice</em></strong>. In the former, the subject performs
  the action; in the latter, the subject receives the action. <strong><em>Too
  much use of the active voice has the tendency to make the text
  monotonous because of too many first-person references. On the other
  hand, overuse of the passive voice can cause the tone of the paper to
  be dry, boring and even pompous</em>.</strong> To ensure that <em>the text is more
  lively and readable,</em> it is best to try and strike a balance. Consider
  the following example:</p>
  
  <p><em>We used eosin-methylene blue agar plates for the preliminary isolation
  of P. aeruginosa. The bacteria were Gram-negative bacilli, and motile.
  The results for oxidase and catalase activities were negative.
  Additional experiments showed that the bacteria did not ferment
  glucose, galactose, maltose or lactose (Table 2). Based on these
  results, we concluded that the organism had an oxidative metabolism.</em></p>
  
  <p>Try translating this in to an entirely passive or active tone.
  <strong>You’ll notice that the creative mix of both voices makes this narrative not only lively and engaging but also states the results in
  a clear, confident and unambiguous manner</strong>.""</p>

12502,"<p>An alternate title could be ""Do we award a PhD for what the student became or for what he produced?"". More precisely, if a research thesis report does not advance human knowledge, yet still shows that the student acquired the right skills of investigation, should the title of Philosophy Doctor be awarded?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I kind of always assumed that a thesis (PhD thesis in particular) should have some positive results (where positive means ""advancing the state of human knowledge""), and that part of the art of finding a good topic of research was the art of asking the right kind of question, which would yield some positive result independently of the answer. Similar views are expressed in this other <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/7421/what-to-do-with-negative-research-outcomes-results-of-phd-research-experiment"">stackexchange</a> question and the corresponding answers: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is an expectation that the PhD would make an original contribution and/or advance knowledge in a given field. I understand this is a universal assumption for this level of study across all universities. (...) usually a PhD is measured on its contribution to expand knowledge.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Nevertheless, Justin Zobel defends convincingly the opposite view in ""Writing for Computer Science"", p.154 of the Second Edition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>even if good results are not achieved, the thesis should pass if you have shown the ability to undertake high-quality research. (...)
  A thesis with negative results can, if appropriately written, demonstrate the ability of the candidate just as well a a thesis with positive results. (...) 
  it is you, not the research, that is the primary object of scrutiny</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>Is there an agreement across disciplines about this question? </p>

<p>I am not directly concerned (I reported positive results in my PhD thesis long ago, have many positive results to report in my ""Habilitation"" thesis, and I certainly aim for my students to report positive results in theirs), but I am curious about the real objective of the thesis: 
- as an advisor, I could suggest a more risky topic if it had the potential to teach more to the student without risking the whole graduating thing; and
- as a referee or member of an evaluation committee, I have to judge students and/or their thesis...</p>

<hr>

<h2>Extreme Fictional Example</h2>

<p>A student and advisor do the entire research work following the most rigorous scientific process for several years, only to find their efforts ruined near the end of the process either by a budget cut, the disappearance of the species they were studying, or the discovery that the problem is the consequence of an obscure results from year ago in another research community.</p>

<p>The student has followed and learned the scientific process, but did not contribute to human knowledge (apart from maybe improving the index of its bibliography).  If the student has showed the qualities required from a good researcher, should(n't) he/she be awarded the title of ""Doctor in Philosophy"", independently of the contribution made to human knowledge?</p>

<p>This is truly a rhetorical question, and I doubt this kind of situation happens often. Yet the idea is new to me and I kind of like it, albeit I doubt the whole community would agree...</p>

<hr>

<h2>Opposite Extreme Example</h2>

<p>Imagine that a student, stroke by luck, makes an amazing scientific discovery which deeply impact human knowledge, and can be understood by all even though the student  poorly redacts it. It seems clear to me that the society would not benefit from awarding a PhD to such a student, who has not learned how to do research even though contributing to human knowledge. </p>

<p>On the other hand, setting two conditions for the awarding of a PhD, having learned how to do proper research AND having advanced human knowledge by using it, introduces trade-offs and compromises (which again do not serve society).</p>

12505,"<p>Some avenues of research require time-intensive research and experimentation (e.g.m sciences). For example, in my case, each experiment took 3-12 hours and I had to perform over 30 of them.</p>

<p>Often, this type of research is performed as part of a group, where group cohesion and harmony are an important factor.  If you caught a member taking ""short cuts"" in their research: for example, doing one trial of an experiment instead of several or, as an extreme case, slightly altering the results to better fit their model. </p>

12514,"<p>I am well aware of the ethic guidelines in the academic publishing world regarding submission for publication of the same article to multiple journals: I know this is broadly considered unethical and creates a bad reputation for the author in question among the academic community (this eventually giving way to negative repercussions –presumably and informal, tacit type of ‘black listing’).</p>

<p>I have a slightly different problem here: </p>

<p>I am wondering what happens if I submit a series of articles, one different article to one different publisher, but all of them more or less at the same time: each of these articles would consist of a theoretical premise (a formula of principles according to which a text’s analysis will be conducted in the article), <strong>which is common to all the articles</strong> in object, and then the main body, different in every article: that would be the analysis itself (on the basis of the formula) of the works of an author –a different author in every article.</p>

<p>The field of research is humanities (literature). I am attempting to determine, on the basis of existing definitions of a literary trend (the aforementioned formula, which itself is a sum up of existing definitions of the literary trend, by other researchers), which authors and which works of theirs may be plausibly associable to the trend.</p>

<p>So, to sum it up, <strong>the formula of analysis (the definition of the trend) is the introductory part of each article</strong>. <strong>Conceptually speaking it is the same for all of them</strong>. I could change the exposition from one article to the other for the sake of not using the same exact text in all articles. The concept(the theoretic formula), however would remain the same: it would mostly not be my own original contribution, give or take a few corrections or specifications I am adding. <strong>The main body of the text –the original contribution to knowledge- is the analysis of the author’s text</strong>: <strong>this is the greatest part of the text and it is different for each article</strong> (one author for every article).</p>

<p>Much of this research has already been done in a draft form. Hopefully at some point in the future, and if these texts are published as articles, I’d be able to organize them (along with a few necessary additions) into a broader text to be submitted for publishing as a book.</p>

<p>So the question is: would this strategy be viewed by any reviewer/publisher/editor as a breach of ethic guidelines in the academic publishing sector? Would it cause me problems of reputation in it?</p>

12529,"<p>There are two closely related questions here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If a student submits their assignment and is unhappy with their mark, are there any dangers (which I might not be seeing) in allowing the students to do so? If I would offer for one, I would offer for all, but <strong>should I be offering it in the first place?</strong></p></li>
<li><p>If resubmits are unavailable, some students ask me to 'pre-read' or 'pre-mark' their assignment. The end result is that when they submit officially, that may actually be the second submission. Clearly doing any 'pre-marking' or the like takes time and energy and, so far, very few students have taken advantage of this until right before the submission deadline (at which point I stop because I don't have THAT much time to offer them). <strong>Are there dangers in 'pre-marking' assignments?</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note: These assignments constitute either 50% or 100% of their total mark.</p>

<p>One of my concerns is that the student would have lower motivation to maximize the quality of their original work and just correct what was marked as a problem area - like a production worker depending on a Quality Control Inspector and not paying as much attention to the quality of their work the first time around. Are there other issues as well? </p>

12558,"<p>I am currently doing my master's under the supervision of an assistant professor. He's brilliant, professional and an amazing mentor. He is supportive but at the same time knows when and how to be tough on me enough to challenge me intellectually and push me to get out of my comfort zone. For all these reasons, he would be the perfect supervisor for my Ph.D. The only problem is that he doesn't work on the same topic as me (and doesn't really have much experience with it either) and seeing that it's a new and tricky topic, I need someone experienced in this particular area.</p>

<p>I spoke to him several times about my plans for my Ph.D. and mentioned that I planned on applying to several major universities and that I was looking for supervisors working on my field of interest. He would keep bringing up the Ph.D. programme at his departement and would tell me that I could work with him and also someone else from another university (co-supervision). I said it could be a good idea, but of course, I was still considering the Ph.D. programmes at other universities (which, I think is normal, I'm only keeping my options open). Of course, he knew that I could enroll in better programmes elsewhere, but he still asked me to stay, more than once (which is flattering since I respect and admire him). The Phd programme he's suggesting is the best option for me ONLY in terms of funding, because it has a special offer for foreign students paying extra fees (which he also knows...).</p>

<p>Now, I recently had a meeting with him and I mentioned that I wanted to do an internship in one of the universities I'm interested in. He said ""It's a good idea and if you like the experience, you can decide to stay there for a Ph.D."". That was one hell of a slap in my face... He basically told me ""Hey, I changed my mind, you're not a worthwhile student, finish your master's, then you're out"". So at the end of our meeting, I decided to be honest and asked ""okay, so if I understand correctly, you no longer want me to stay here for my Ph.D.?"", to which he answered ""No, I do. But I want you to explore your options. I don't want you to stay just because you think it's your only option but because you believe it's the RIGHT option for you.""</p>

<p>In my experience, the range of salary for a postdoctoral fellow is much less than an assistant professor, something between $25,000 - $50,000. In Europe, it is in the lower side, but it is usually higher in the US.</p>

<p>It should be an excellent approach for mid-level professors/researchers who can establish a research group in a top university (where it is normally hard to get that position) and get research fund from external sources such as industry and funding agencies.</p>

However, I still do not see a contradiction between research professor and self-endowed professor. Does a endowed chair must be necessary result of a huge donation to university? or a foundation can merely fund a professor position. If it is the latter case, one should be able to fund his own endowed position too.</p>

12645,"<p>A good academic job normally needs excellent recommendation. Due to the rapid growth of higher education, there are too many vacancies (in new or expanding universities) and too many applicants (growing number of graduates). As a result, each vacancy receives many applications, and each applicant need to apply for many positions.</p>

<p>This is how the matchmaking system works: keeps submitting applications.</p>

<p>Although, online systems are replacing hardcopy applications, still many universities prefer application by mail, and more often, they ask for recommendation letters to be submitted by mail. I have seen this very common in Europe.</p>

<p>Thus, each job-seeking scholar must ask his/her colleagues, professors, etc to submit tens of recommendation letters by mail. Owing to the fact that every famous scholar has/had many students/colleagues. Therefore, a part of this schedule must be devoted to writing recommendation letters for others.</p>

<p>Considering that people need recommendation for other purposes such as grant proposal, admission application, fellowship, etc; this matter must be more serious.</p>

The situation being the student demanding better guidance on his research or while reporting complaints on unavailability of research facilites(infrastructure).

And partly some professors think behaving rudely is the right way to scare students away so that they don't come back and trouble them. Also often the faculty feel they are being embarassed by being compared to their peers elsewhere and are being looked down upon, so have a bellicose attitude and start fighting at the slightest provocation. This is extremely frustrating for graduate students and they ask themselves why they made this grave mistake of joining for graduate studies here.

12764,"<p>As far as I experienced, research is the most important factor for promotion, as it represents different features of an academician/scholar, which are needed by higher education institutions: teaching at graduate level, supervising academic projects of graduate students, attracting research fund, fame for the university, etc.</p>

<p>Publications is normally the main measure for research of a professor. Thus, one expects to see a proportional relationship between publications (both quality and quantity) and academic rank.</p>

<p>People can be promoted with less publications, probably because of other activities. But, I wonder why there are some academicians whose rank is far behind their publications. For example, I have seen people with 50 papers but are still assistant professor, or over 100 papers but still associate professor. I am referring to the US universities.</p>

12767,"<p>I very recently came across a <a href=""http://crypto.junod.info/2013/09/09/an-aspiring-scientists-frustration-with-modern-day-academia-a-resignation/"">blog entry</a> which was about a PhD candidate quitting a few weeks/months shy of completing the degree due to frustration with the way academia works in general. </p>

<p>Now you may agree or disagree with the notions put forth, but both the anonymous letter and the long row of comments it has attracted certainly provides an interesting and lively discussion, relevant to many academics if not all.</p>

<p>One particular subject it got me thinking about is the choice of projects, safe-and-uninteresting vs daring-and-interesting. For those who do not feel like reading the discussion in the blog, essentially it's about how many researchers go for projects that have little to no impact practically, in fields where a lot of the ""interesting"" work is put forth. Such projects are essentially after small incremental additions to the literature, more often than not special case scenarios, or replication of previously demonstrated results with other methods than previously reported. </p>

<p>I am currently at a large conference, and I started reflecting on this subject. I noticed how the ""better"" speakers claim of excellence, or ground-breaking research, the-whole-picture type projects (e.g. ""mapping out the entire human kinome"", or ""developing antibodies for each and every human protein""). Currently I am sitting with my iPad observing people passing by my poster from some distance. Just like I suspected most people just pass by and barely even stop to read more than a sentence. That's how poster-sessions work you might say, but I am confident that a major contributor to this is the fact that the project I am presenting is inherently not that interesting; it's about a rare disease, effecting mostly elder patients, and does not involve the newest and hottest instrument or technique. I can only imagine that editors and reviewers will be equally unimpressed with the manuscript when we submit this study.</p>

<p>That being the case I got into thinking whether or not it's actually worth getting into such a study. I feel like I have put a lot of time and energy into something that's not really my field of study and not liekly to have a rich ""return-of-investment"". Before I go to my supervisor and have a serious chat about this I would like to get some feedback on whether or not this is a common phenomennon, within the biomedical sciences/academia in general. As scientists-to-be is our primary responsibility to ourselves, to our bosses/departments, or to science itself?</p>

12774,"<p>I have just read a recent paper in a well-respected journal. The work is technically sound and the results interesting. However, the authors comment their main results as unexpected and “extraordinary” (in the abstract and in the text), while it is an instance of a very generic and well-known phenomenon, which has been experimentally confirmed (and theoretically explained) in a large range of systems in the last decade. The author do not seem aware of the literature on this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Another colleague made an off-hand 'joke' about a friend (an academic) potentially behaving inappropriately with his students.  This was said in front of my friend's students (over 20) and within hearing range of his students, as my friend heard them laughing soon after the 'joke' was said (his own students apparently had shocked looks on their faces).</p>

<p>The situation was that he was setting up an experiment demonstration that required the lights turned off and curtains drawn (physics - lasers).  Understandably, my friend was very angry, hurt and terribly embarrassed and could not bare to even look at his colleague who 'triumphantly went back to his own class' soon after.</p>

<p>Just a point I want to make here, the reason I am saying 'joke' in inverted commas, is because this kind of infantile rubbish can and does cause unwarranted mud to stick - and is potentially a lot more damaging for male teachers/lecturers.  Also, it is a lame, disgusting, low-brow attempt at humour. (I have been a butt of a joke like that myself a few years ago and it inadvertently caused quite a bit of trouble, despite being 100% innocent and proven so).</p>

<p>There is no question of his innocence of any wrong doing, and being the true professional, he redirected his students back to the demonstration and completed the lesson.</p>

<li><p>Lecturer Y went back to his class.</p></li>
<li><p>Lecturer X was justifiably insulted, but continued his lesson.</p></li>

<p>He has been able to score just around average grades in all the subjects primarily owing to class projects. The problem he attributes to is that he is not at all good at reproducing things during the examination. In fact, while studying, he tends to ignore all the information like names of techniques, methods etc and just focus on what and how things work. In fact, he doesn't like to write the exam at all and usually just focus on the most tempting or the most thought provoking questions in the paper. (and just writes something to other questions for the sake of writing).</p>

<p>Now, he is just falling short(by 0.2) of the CGPA criteria set at our university to convert to a PhD. So, not being able to properly write examinations and not being able to score good grades, makes him a weak potential candidate for a PhD or does it affects his chances of successfully completing a PhD ?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Past PhD student/post-doctoral fellow who is now an assistant professor</strong>: probably he is the best person to describe the
applicant's attitude towards students and education (something that
is critical for the search committee).</li>
<li><strong>A faculty colleague</strong>: closely witnessed the applicant works, but not directly involved.</li>
<li><strong>Department chair</strong>: supervised the applicant, but probably his view is just the standpoint of a boss.</li>
<li><strong>Dean</strong>: had less connection with the applicant, but can provide a top view about the applicant.</li>
<li><strong>Provost/Vice Presidents</strong>: very little direct connection, but can show the applicant's relationship with senior people.</li>

13034,"<p>I'm currently having a hard time understanding if authors are using the word <code>methodology</code> correctly, or if their papers should be classified as BS. Hence, I set out to get a better feeling for the correct use of the word, but now I'm even more confused than before:</p>

<p>First I had a look at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"" rel=""nofollow"">wikipedia</a> which states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Methodology is the systematic, theoretical analysis of the methods applied to a field of study, or the theoretical analysis of the body of methods and principles associated with a branch of knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sentence is followed by a second sentence with reference to a paper from S.I. Irny, which as far as I could see, states something very contracting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Methodology is generally a guideline for solving a problem, with
  specific components such as phases, tasks, methods, techniques and
  tools [two sources are given]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though I think the wikipedia description is identical with my understanding of the term, the reference is confusion. I then asked <a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/methodology"" rel=""nofollow"">Merriam &amp; Webster</a> for help. Here it says:</p>

<pre><code>1:  a body of methods, rules, and postulates employed by a discipline : a particular procedure or set of procedures
2:  the analysis of the principles or procedures of inquiry in a particular field
</code></pre>

<p>Oxford says a discipline is branch of knowledge, which I would interpret as things like math, sociology, computer science and psychology, but not things like UML modeling, crossword solving, methods for solving a problem, or even sticking together methods to solve a problem. This does not match the <code>discipline : a particular procedure or a set of procedures</code> part of the definition. </p>

<p>And then again they give a weird example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;for solving crossword puzzles my usual methodology is to begin by
filling in all of the answers I'm reasonably sure of&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>brackets indicate that they chose a poor example, or they consider crosswords a discipline (case 1). It obviously doesn't qualify for case 2, as the example does not analyse methods used in the crossword domain.</p>

<p>Sadly, Oxford defines the term as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a system of methods used in a particular area of study or activity: a
  methodology for investigating the concept of focal points</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which again is used as a method/solution for a problem and not the theorecial study of methods in that field. Only the ""Methodology as a buzzword"" section on wikipedia seems to back up my understanding of the term:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many recent uses of the word methodology mistakenly treat it a synonym
  for method or body of methods. Doing this shifts it away from its true
  epistemological meaning and reduces it to being the procedure itself,
  the set of tools or the instruments that should have been its outcome.
  A methodology is the design process for carrying out research or the
  development of a procedure and is not in itself an instrument for
  doing those things. Using it as a synonym for method or set of
  methods, leads to misinterpretation and undermines the proper analysis
  that should go into designing research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Is my understanding that a methodology is, as the name suggests it, a logic behind methods, and consequently must not deal with the topic per se, but address some meta level of the used methods, wrong?</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> For my particular academic problem in CS: Is the combination of general priciples and rules as part of a standard for creating a particular type of operating system a methodology (e.g. as used in AUTOSAR)? Such principles and rules govern and describe communication mechanisms, memory access methods, scheduling and the like. I would call this a body of methods, hence this must be a buzzword?</p>

<p><strong>Additional fact</strong>: My Sixth edition Oxford from 1976 says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Science of method; body of methods used in a particular branch of
  activity;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in the current version they dumped the actual meaning and only used that weird body of method definition.</p>

<p>I'm happy about any source bringing some clarity into this mess. Don't worry if you can't answer the CS specific question, a general purpose answer may well be just as good.</p>

13069,"<p>I have had a few professors who announced to the class the mean and median scores for each exam, but I haven't seen anyone go further than this (e.g., announce this information for homework too, give a histogram of all the scores, etc.). Also, this information has always been kept semi-private, in the sense that it is announced verbally in class, without an explicit instruction <strong>not</strong> to share it, but still making it unlikely that the information would spread beyond the class.</p>

<p>I'm wondering what to take into consideration when deciding what sort of information to provide, and how. Would it be acceptable to put the mean and median scores for each exam on my (publicly available) website, for example? Or is that violating the privacy of my students in some way? Might they be ashamed, as a group, if they've all done extraordinarily badly? But as their teacher, I would have to also be ashamed if that were the case - so perhaps deciding to publicize how my students are doing ought to be considered as a sign of confidence that my teaching will make them do well. </p>

13133,"<p>So, to start with my question... PhDs/research are undoubtedly hard/stressful, but how much is too much? Should I leave my PhD in my 6th year or just take a bit of a leave to try and regroup? (I'm 31 if that makes any difference.)</p>

<p>As with most, my path through grad school has not been straightforward and I apologize in advance for the lengthy background/question. </p>

<p>I received my MS and was planning to continue for a PhD at University A (contingent upon me getting funding + suitable project). Got both of those figured out, but my advisor was told my project would not help her tenure case and had an awkward advisor switch. Got fed up with politics at A then transferred to University B (in year 4) where I have a fantastic and super supportive advisor. </p>

<p>I just started my 6th year, but have not yet taken my qualifying exam. Many reasons for this, but mostly the program at Univ A was more interdisciplinary (better matched to my research) while the program at Univ B is much more traditional/focused on fundamentals. I  need to relearn a lot of material which is not really relevant to my research and have been at a complete loss of motivation for months now. Being daunted by oral exams certainly plays a role, but also feel that a PhD is no longer required as my career goals have also shifted. </p>

<p>All of this, switching schools, etc. etc. has taken its toll on my emotionally/mentally to the point where my research progress is practically non-existent. This has all triggered pretty severe anxiety/depression (yes, I am getting help elsewhere too), but even so, I am seriously questioning whether it is really worth putting myself through this any more.</p>

<p>I love my research topic (on good days), but at what point is the stress of a PhD not worth it anymore?  </p>

<li>I was not paid by the research institution (UU), either</li>
<li>Though I am keeping an eye on the research project, I did not do any significant work since my internship ended (vacations, then too busy with courses)</li>

While there are other students who are quick at grasping things transmitted orally like in a lecture and despise reading it through books.

Right now I am working in the lab with another PhD candidate; both of us have been funded by departmental funds until now.</p>

<p>The PhD is working on a project which has no funding. I am working on a corporate-funded project for my thesis.  Now I am the PI for this project internally. So I did the whole project as my thesis and I was listed as the PI on consent form )approved by my univ IRB)when I carried out the final testing of my product with the corporate sponsor.</p>

<p>Here is where things turn shady. When I carried out my testing, we paid the participants through my research funds [the account number for the project is listed on some departmental documents that I had to sign to get cheques for test participants]. In my GRA contract, it was specified that my funding was coming from the departmental account and when the PhD candidate showed me his contract, he was getting funded from my project account [his stipend account number was my project account number and I have confirmed this with a student departmental.assistant]. His stipend was coming from my project funds.</p>

<p>I spoke with few other people in the department, and came to know that when the department gives seed funding to new professors, there is a limit in stipend they can give.  So to give the PhD student more funding, my advisor is using my research funds (for which I am PI) to pay his stipend and he is getting double my stipend.   I am still getting funded by the department, so I get a lot less.</p>

<p>Screwed-up thing is this project is highly successful as I did a lot of hard work and I am not getting any financial incentive. In fact, it's all going to the other guy and he is nowhere involved in this project. The sponsor is giving my advisor funding for second phase next month and also offered me a full-time job at their corporation. I should probably mention that I don't have a good relationship with my advisor and we fought multiple times in past due to some other issues but the PhD candidate gets along with her very well. He is like a family friend and have a very good social interactions.</p>

<p>I am graduating this December, so it probably won't matter anyway but is this ethical? Can I speak with my department chair about this?

At the same time, there's also the challenge of ensuring that the research problem can be done at the school one has chosen, and not narrowing things so specifically that the student is too ""boxed in"" or too opaque for a review panel to see the merits of.</p>

13256,"<p>let me explain a bit about myself before getting to the question.  I graduated recently in May with a Computer Engineering degree and a minor in CS.  Originally I wanted to go into embedded development, but after a few courses in it I decided that it wasn't for me.  At that point it was a little late for me to switch so I went with getting the CS minor instead, and took all the CS related engineering courses that I could.  Naturally there is a lot of overlap between the two disciplines, and if all of my classes mapped over I was only two classes away from double majoring, but due to departmental reasons the CS department wouldn't accept any of my courses.</p>

<p>I've been working for the past four months at my job and performing very well.  My work has a tuition reimbursement program that covers 8k per year of schooling/books.  I've noticed that I have some gaps in knowledge compared to new computer science graduates such as with compilers, databases, and machine learning.  </p>

<p><strong>So here's my question:</strong> Do you think it would be beneficial for me to enroll in a part-time masters program?  Should I just learn these things on my own?  Now that I have cash coming in I don't want to go full-time.  I'm asking this now because Georgia Tech just opened up registration for their <a href=""http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">online Masters program</a> and it seems like I'm the perfect candidate for it.  Am I really going to earn that much extra or get a better position than I would with normal work experience that would justify the extra 20 hours of work per week this would give me (2 classes a semester for 3 years)?  With my work reimbursement this program would be free and simply a time investment.  My manager at work recommended doing it now before I have a wife and kids to deal with later.  I would love to continue learning and I guess I could stretch it out longer than 3 years if I needed to, or stop at any time and have no financial loss.</p>

13265,"<p>I have been reading some reflections on research and academia lately, and it has gotten me to think more critically towards what we do, and what the life we are pursuing has in store for us. </p>

<p>Some of you might remember <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/12767/project-design-and-scope-interesting-vs-incremental-science"">another recent question of mine</a>, where I was inquiring about the right way to set up projects based on an open-letter I read  about how academia is not what it claims to be. Now I have stumbled upon <a href=""http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1439"">this blog entry</a> which focuses on the shortcomings of the single-blind peer review process overwhelmingly used in biomedical research publication. </p>

<p>Now it all brings me back to a disturbing idea that I had some time ago; that the quality of the research and the truth to all we do is essentially hanging on a rather fragile virtue, what one could call ""academic honesty"". We count on the reviewers and editors objectivity, we count on publishers <strong>and</strong> researchers naive and good intentions with their work, we count on people not putting their personal benefits before that of the society. </p>

<p>As anyone out on the streets will tell you, we do not live in an ideal world and [<em>call me a pessimist if you will</em>] thus I don't believe in the inherent good of the people (at least I do not rely or count on it). I don't see how academics should be exempt from a degeneration in the society that affects everyone else. </p>

<p>That brings me to my question; what measures exist to ensure this ""academic honesty"" we seem to rely so heavily on? How do we know/ensure:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>that the reviewers do not lose their objectivity, for instance when looking at a manuscript of a competitor</p></li>
<li><p>that there's no collusion between high-profile PIs and editors of ""high-impact"" journals?</p></li>
<li><p>that academics (at varying stages of their career) do not consider/prioritize ""pushing up"" the numbers (e.g. ""h-index"" or ""impact factor"" etc) when they set out with their research projects? </p></li>
<li><p>that grants/prizes/titles are actually given to the better projects/people from the perspective of the greater good, and not based on how well-connected the applicants are? (after all such committees <em>need</em> to have or be composed of other researchers, who else is going to be able to judge the impact and importance of cutting edge research than other researchers?) </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I realize that it's a broad question, but I have tried to give a thorough background story to give you an idea about how I got to this idea. Likewise I tried to narrow my concern to one over-arching question (rather than to seek discussion), with a couple of example follow-up questions to make my point clear. I can ask them separately if-need-be, but I think they sit better together, as is. </p>

For example paper <code>X</code> has a list of references, call it <code>bibliography[X]</code>.

The idea is then to go to all the papers <code>Y</code> in <code>bibliography[X]</code> and repeat the process for the papers in each <code>bibliography[Y]</code> up to some depth. </p>

<p>On the other hand, we could also look at the citing articles of <code>X</code>, which is also displayed in the journal's webpage as well as in other resources, e.g. Google Scholar.</p>

<p>In this way the tree of references/citing articles of <code>X</code> up to some depth can be obtained and plotted in a nice graphical framework and perhaps display relevant information of the vertices of the tree like title, doi, etc. In my opinion this would be a very nice and efficient way of discovering new papers related to some paper, e.g. a seminal paper (citing articles tree) or to look into the history of a subject (references tree).</p>

13363,"<p>I've become quite upset with how lectures for my courses are conducted. </p>

<p>Everyday, I attend lectures where the teacher simply writes definitions and theorems on the board straight from one of our textbooks (or another professor's published lecture notes). They then prove a handful of the theorems, or part of them, and leave more than half as an exercise. They do little to motivate the material or provide insight based on their professional experiences, and are often scribbling material onto the board as fast as possible to cover some predetermined amount. And sometimes the professor writes proofs straight from their notes and, when questioned, has a hard time explaining the gaps between steps (as they are simply regurgitating and not really even attentive to what they are explaining).</p>

<p>Ultimately, I feel like these lectures are a waste of my time. To be blunt, I can read a book and I can do exercises. I don't need someone to paraphrase a book for me and then tell me to fill in the rest myself. Moreover, since I cannot afford to live on/near campus, I have to commute an hour each way to sit through such lectures, which hardly seems validated.</p>

<p>I would like to attend lectures where the professor engages the students. Often, my professors are so rushed to scribble things on the board that they take few questions and relegate them to exercises (yes, I had a professor answer a simple question about his proof by assigning it as an exercise). If an instructor wants to cover some predetermined amount of material, I would prefer they assign this as reading beforehand and then take questions on that material in class. It'd also be nice if they presented us with hard problems in class and then we all worked through them together (with students presenting them, everyone critiquing, etc.).</p>

<p>Should I approach my professors about my feelings? How should I go about this?</p>

<p>To be honest, I am becoming quite bored (and frustrated) and starting to skip lectures in favor of office hours (which are far more engaging), reading the book on my own, and working extra problems. I do not like that I am not enjoying my educational experience (since I love to learn math!).</p>

13373,"<p>I am employed as a student in a theoretical computer science research group and part of my job was to assist my supervisor with a scientific paper he has been working on.
Concretely, my job was to implement the software that was used to conduct the experimental part of the research paper and also to gather and put together a dataset in order to empirically test the theoretical framework developed by my supervisor using real-world data.</p>

<p>Before the first submission attempt, I was mentioned in the list of the co-authors. However, the paper was not accepted on the grounds that the empirical results only weakly reflected the theoretical claims.</p>

<p>My supervisor thought that the rejection was due to a bug in the code I've developed and afterwards he removed me both from the list of co-authors and from the project. I am very sure that the code didn't contain any bugs.</p>

<p>Afterwards, my supervisor contacted a fellow student who was already working on a different topic, and asked for his permission to use the data from this different topic in order to test the theory.</p>

<p>The second submission attempt of the research paper was successful and the paper was accepted. My fellow student appeared in the list of co-authors but I didn't.</p>

<p>The version of the paper that finally got accepted differed from the first one that got rejected, in that it contained only an extra experiment, using the data from my fellow student. However, the initial empirical experiments that I put together were still there. They have not been removed, nor modified.</p>

<p>Regarding this situation I have a series of questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is it normal to feel that I have been treated unfairly? I feel that the only reason why I have been removed from the list of co-authors is because the dataset I have compiled simply didn't confirm the expected theoretical results and me getting fired was simply a way for my supervisor to vent his frustration about being rejected.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it legal to publish a paper that uses data and software that some other person developed and not mention this person as a co-author (or at least as a reference)? Are there any laws or rules of conduct regarding such situations?</p></li>

<p>But I have a real problem. </p>

<p>The topics on which I worked with my adviser are purely mathematical (differential geometry). I began to study this branch of math 2 years ago. But 1 year ago, due to a suggestion of my friend, I started reading articles on Theoretical Computer Science (namely algorithms on planar graphs and in Linear Algebra but nothing related to numerical methods) and became carried away by that. For some reasons, I couldn't have abandoned the work on my topics. One of them is that the results in differential geometry we eventually obtained are excellent (together with my advisor we have two articles in good mathematical journals). Since this is the last year of my education at my University, I haven't changed the field for my diploma (it would have had no sense and it would have been impossible in some way, but let me not tell about it). </p>

<p>Differential Geometry is very interesting and I know much about it but I feel that algorithms is the field to which my future research will be dedicated. I am not interested in any other field of CS. By the way, my scientific advisor knows about my future plans (reported to him half a year ago). He also heartily agreed to write a strong letter of recommendation for me.</p>

<p>So what have I got? Good mathematical skills: a wide spectrum of knowledge on many fields including algebra (linear and abstract), advanced analysis, differential geometry (as mentioned before), functional analysis, combinatorics, algorithms, graph theory... I also have medals and prizes earned on mathematical olympiads (IMO, IMC). So math and TCS background is not a problem for me. After all, Theoretical Computer Science is the same math (we also state and prove theorems like in math)!</p>

<p>Why a PHD? Because I absolutely know that one-two years spent on getting a MS finished will be just a waste of my time.</p>

<p>So I feel difficulty when composing a Statement of Purpose. I just don't know in which way I should put the description of my personal experience forward in such a way so it would be clear and laconic. I don't want the reader to be confused about my goals. I don't want my statement of purpose to be a fruit-salad. I want the reader to understand that a PHD in CS is what I need since I am completely determined about my intentions. </p>

<p>Even though title itself seems quite similar to other questions asked here, my question is a bit different from other similar questions. I know it's a bit long, but I do appreciate anyone who has a read through it. Cheers.</p>

<p>I am a Ph.D. student in UK and it has been 5 months since I started it. My topic was something completely new (to me) so as one might guess, I've spent these 5 months reviewing the literature and covering what I didnt know. Problems started right here.</p>

<p>I am working at a Research Institute that has expertise on something totally different than my Ph.D. (let's name it field A, and name my Ph.D. field B). Simply, A and B have nothing in common (except both are engineering topics, but subfields are different). And as a result, this laboratory doesnt have the required equipment or facilities that i need for my Ph.D. MOST IMPORTANTLY, there is not a single person around me in the lab who have a single bit of knowledge about my topic, thus no practical help or chances of hands on experience. Speaking of the good parts; I am getting a proper work experience (since this research institute has industrial focus), my scholarship is a substantial amount and my supervisor (even though he is sort of clueless about my topic, he is a HUGE figure in field A) is quite impressed with my progress.</p>

<p>But, as always, I have an alternative. There is another lab in my university which has expertise on field B (my Ph.D.). In this lab, there are people who have expertise in field B and of course, director of the lab is a powerful figure in field B. I know it sounds good so far,but here are the cons of this alternative: Lab director says he cant give any sort of guarantees regarding a scholarship (which means i have to pay tuition fees as well, good old UK) and he wants me to work in a new project(a new field, field C). This field C, again completely different from A and B, is a newer topic compared to B and there are lots of research going on in this field. Field B is sort of an established field, I am just trying to squeeze whatever's left out it.</p>

<p>So on one side, I have a good working experience, phd in field B, an impressed supervisor, yet no practical help about field B or collaboration whatsoever. On the other side, I have a group of people who have expertise in field B and C, yet no money. I personally dont have any problems about changing my phd from B to C, the only disadvantage will be losing 6 months of work and naturally, getting 6 months of extension in the end.

13444,"<p>There are quite a few question aiming at or hinting towards avoiding academic burn-out, but I couldn't come across one that targets interaction with a colleague that has suffered from a serious burn-out, which can be very tricky as I am learning nowadays.</p>

<p>Background: A colleague of mine (office-mate actually) has suffered a pretty major crisis over the past year and had to take an extended leave of absence due to stress. The person in question was/is close to disputation but due to the fact that s/he could not handle being at work anymore, everything was postponed. </p>

<p>After several months away, my colleague is trying to get back in the game by starting off 20%. I heard that it didn't work out all too good the first attempt, a couple of weeks later s/he is attempting to start again. As we were chatting the other day, I realized that I can't really say much without tripping my colleague off, in the sense  that the subject often raises old issues somehow and causes some frustration/stress for my colleague. That partially originates from the fact that most of what we have in common and talk about is work oriented somehow. </p>

<p>My natural reflex when I realize that the subject causes discomfort is to not feed the conversation and attempt to change the subject. But that doesn't really work too good, as it's not very discrete. I also suspect that specially avoiding small-talk with my office mate isn't very nice either, I dont want the person to feel isolated and alone. I mean the fact that a person had a stress-related problem, it's not something that one should be ashamed or embarrassed about, it shouldn't be awkward socially, but somehow it does feel like that.</p>

13446,"<p>Often, when speaking English in research, you can find a great variety of (mostly, non-native) accents. Since I started moving in academic circles and a more international environment, I slowly learned to understand some of the accents much better. I can currently understand well most mild accents and some specific accents even if they are strong, but there are still both <em>researchers with very strong accents</em> and <em>types of accents I have a very hard time understanding</em>.</p>

<p>As networking, communicating, and generally talking to other researchers is very important, it got me wondering about what I can to to <strong>overcome this ""accent barrier""</strong>.</p>

<p>I've encountered this ""accent barrier"" in at least three different settings, and there's always problems arising for that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>speakers and presenters on conferences (or other big events)</p>

<p>I usually try and decide from the slides (and what I can understand) how relevant I think the presented material is for me, and then I would read the paper later on my own.</p>

<p>Still, it means that I could <em>miss some interesting papers</em>, <em>miss some of the authors insight on the problem only mentioned in the presentation</em> and <em>loose a certain amount of time, because listening to a talk is much faster than reading</em> (especially if one just wants to understand the basic idea).</p></li>
<li><p>poster sessions and social events on conferences / other manifestations</p>

<p>This one is a bit more tricky since it's more personal interaction. I would usually try and ask the person to clarify or reformulate the question, and then if I still don't understand try talking about something related to ""keywords"" that I succeeded to identify. If it's a social occasion, I would try to look attentive, smile, and excuse myself the first acceptable opportunity I get.</p>

<p>And again, I might be missing on some great ideas this way. Missing making some potentially useful contacts with the people from the community, and even possibly looking rude if I didn't understand something crucial.</p></li>
<li><p>interactions with people from you team/close environment.</p>

<p>With this one, I'm totally at a loss. I know how much team dynamics is important. If something like that happened, I would probably try and avoid one-on-one communication with that person as much as possible. Still, it would probably make me feel constantly uncomfortable.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What <strong>are some suggestions on how to act in such situations?</strong> They generally make me feel uncomfortable, and often afraid that I'll offend somebody. Again, I do believe that a little practice and effort can go a long way to understanding different accents, especially when they are not <em>too strong</em>. But (and I guess this also depends on ones mother tongue) I think a lot of people have problems with (probably different) strong accents.</p>

13454,"<h1>General background</h1>

<p>In the cognitive sciences, it is often necessary to program/script experimental paradigms to conduct your studies. Basically, these programs present stimuli and collect responses, such as in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eriksen_flanker_task"" rel=""nofollow"">Eriksen Flanker task</a>. However, programming capacities are typically limited in my field because it is rarely taught during graduate education (at least in my country). Also, it seems there is a somewhat reluctant culture of sharing this software unless there is some sort of scientific cooperation.</p>

<p>Consequently, when designing a study the decision for one of several paradigms used to measure a given construct can, among other things, be motivated by availability of the software or the effort necessary to implement it. With respect to sound science (choosing the most appropriate rather than available paradigm, software bugs, etc.), reproducibility (incomplete descriptions of methods, lack of programming skills, etc.), speed of scientific development, and, more generally, open science this is less than optimal.</p>

<h1>The situation at hand</h1>

<p>For a current study, I have started to implement three paradigms from scratch for different reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>One paradigm is publicly available from the authors but implemented in a commercial development environment for which I don't have a license (I, therefore, can't run it). </li>
<li>Another paradigm, to my knowledge, is not available from the authors at all. I contacted the authors for a copy of the software but got no reply.</li>
<li>The third paradigm is commercially available but is also closed source and only grants access to a limited set of the response data. For my analyses, I'd like to have access to richer data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given my prior general considerations, I think about releasing my implementations of the paradigms under an open source license, once they are finished. Now my question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are issues to consider when I release my software to collect data in an experimental paradigm, which was conceived by another scientist, under an open source license?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some of the things I'm wondering about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there <strong>legal issues</strong>, such as copyright infringement, to be considered for commercially or non-commercially available software? Note, I created all of the code and  all images based on low resolution prints in publications. I'm merely copying the concept.</li>
<li>Would such a release conflict with common <strong>etiquette</strong> in the case where the software is simply not available from the original authors (remember, I asked but got no reply)? Is it necessary to ask each author before releasing my code?</li>
<li>Can I be <strong>held responsible morally</strong> if the software is used and turns out to be faulty? I'm less concerned about legal responsibility because the license I intend to use does not provide warranty. More importantly, I certainly intend for the software to work since I'll use it my self but you never know.</li>
<li>If my study ends up being published and points to the availability of the software, can this benefit the <strong>citation count</strong> of the publication?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure there are more things to consider that I haven't thought of. But that's why I'm asking the question. ;)</p>

13457,"<p>I have no formal work experience. I have a BA in sociology and went into graduate school for education. Instead of following my instincts or really thinking about whether I could teach childhood as a job, I told myself it would feel more natural. It has not.</p>

<p>I will fail this program if I have to teach full-time, which is required to graduate (as is an exam that's so new there are no prep books, and it is required to stay in this program). I am in my mid twenties and have zero formal work experience. Foolishly, I'm one of those people that could barely juggle a full courseload and work. I've always chosen school and realized too late that graduate school was a horrible choice for me. </p>

<p>In terms of anything resembling work, I've assisted as a volunteer in classrooms, written papers and portfolios, and have put two years into this program but am incredibly unhappy and cannot finish, nor do I want to be in this profession anymore. I thought it was the one way to put my useless liberal arts degree into a professional path.</p>

<p>Before that, I went through a year and a half after graduation looking for entry level office job, bookstores, retail...no callbacks. Maybe three interviews in the whole time. Temp agencies stopped responding and when I called one to ask why they weren't calling me in to offer advisement, they said they'd have to call me. I graduated with a 3.0 but my resume was too weak, I guess. I had friends look at it to see that it was passable, but as I said I have no experience and I'm now in my mid-20s. (And for what it's worth, am incredibly ashamed of myself.) No experience, no work. My family says I am ""unemployable"" and I fear they're right--I was in this program two years and should have pulled out sooner. It looks suspicious. If nothing else, it is damaging because I went to school full-time instead of working. </p>

<p>The time, money, and effort I spent on this makes me feel bad, but the lack of a degree/ANY work experience in all that time makes me feel worse. </p>

<p>So there it is, I have no work experience AND no degree to explain the time gap. Can I salvage this? I feel embarrassed even to put the school on my resume b/c of the lack of a degree, but it's the only thing I have to show for the last few years. </p>

<p>(This is in teaching/early childhood. I don't know how to spin graduate school into first experience in even a basic clerical job.)</p>

13489,"<p>Recently I caught a paper which had plagiarized my paper. Several sentences had been copied from my article without citing my article. Some of the copied sentences had been shuffled, so the words were the same but the order of the words had been changed. Some other sentences were exactly copied from my article. Besides, all the copied sentences in the new article appeared in approximately same places to the original sentences used by me in my article. I am not inexperienced in academia and without any severe bias, it was quite obvious that they have picked my sentences. Even the citations at the end of my sentences had been used in the same order in the new article... Moreover, the style of my sentences were unique to my article and not inspired from another article. So it was not possible that those authors were copying from another source other than my paper.</p>

He didn't respond. So I searched for and found the email addresses of all the editorial members of the journal and emailed them the same letter, frequently. All the emails were correct and running. Only one of the addresses bounced my letter. So I am pretty sure they have received my emails.</p>

I was selected in the Company's User Experience Team which had a discrete purpose of harmonizing the UI across the Suite of applications.</p>

<p>I left my job after 2 years as I wanted to learn more about some technologies that I was not getting an opportunity to work on while going to office. I left my job after 2.5 years and followed my passion of developing applications on github. Now I feel I want to get a more deeper understanding of technologies, I need expert guidance and a systemized curriculum, and that is why I am applying for a Masters program this year.</p>

  <p>Because no antitoxins as yet have been developed to counteract the novel C. Botulinum toxin, the authors had detailed consultations with representatives from numerous appropriate US government agencies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The team sequenced the bacterial DNA corresponding to the toxin, but did not publish it.</p>

<p>I can understand the reasoning, and see how it might make sense, but I wondered: in such a case, what are guidelines that should be followed? The editors indicate consultations with governmental agencies, but I think the government might in some case be overly eager to censor data that should, from an ethical and moral point of view, be disseminated.</p>

<p>So, without turning this into a political question: <strong>what are guidelines (written rules as well as unwritten moral standards) that an author, reviewer or editor should follow concerning potential public safety issues?</strong> I looked for information on the <a href=""http://publicationethics.org"">COPE website</a>, but could not really find anything relevant.</p>

In this spirit, I am asking what can be a reviewer's role in this — I'll explain fully below.</em></p>

<p>Like many people, I would like to see academic research moving toward a more “open data” model, especially because the principle of reproducibility of research is central to the scientific method. However, I know that at least in my field (theoretical chemistry), the usual standards are pretty lax. I'll give two examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you develop your own simulation/modeling code, you do not have to make it public in order to publish your results.</li>
<li>If you use an existing modeling code (available for free or commercial), you do not need to include your full/raw input files with your publication.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I peer-reviewed papers for publication in the past, I typically did not ask for this, because (a) maybe my standards are not other people's standards, and (b) the role of the reviewer is more to advise on the quality of the science and analysis of the results.</p>

<p>But, over time, I'm not really satisfied with this approach any more. So: as a reviewer, how much information do you think is reasonable to request from the authors? <strong>Should you follow the customs and unwritten standards of your field, or is it okay to push it toward the direction you'd like to see it go? And how much can you push?</strong></p>

<p>However, this makes it hard for me to differentiate between the curves.  Color is <em>much</em> more effective for helping people distinguish between data (and I'm taking a data visualization class that has research to prove it).</p>

<p>So... can I do this in my research article?  I imagine most people are keeping their plots black and white because of printing restrictions on color, but at the same time they include colors in all kinds of other figures in their document.  Also, how many people actually read print articles anymore?  For scientific work, I look all of it up online.</p>

13687,"<p>I teach at a community college, and my experience with textbook reps is that they're very friendly and persistent, but ultimately all they've really done is to give me a copy of their book and try to convince me to adopt it. There are certainly many unethical things about textbook publishing, but as far as I could see, they were decisions made by executives in New York (e.g., bringing out new editions to kill off the used market, or shrinkwrapping the book with useless trinkets so that it couldn't be returned). In online discussions, I've often heard people who seem to be students make claims that professors were ""bribed"" to use a particular publisher's book. I never believed these claims, and when I asked these people to supply evidence, they never had any.</p>

<p>But recently I was talking to a colleague in another department, and he told me that his department would never change their book for a particular course, because his colleagues got ethically questionable inducements from the publisher. When I asked him what they were, he said that the publisher would, e.g., repeatedly invite faculty who were using the book to ""meet-the-author"" events in Florida. He said that these faculty had grown to expect this as a perk that they were regularly offered as an unspoken quid pro quo for continuing to use the book. I didn't ask him for hard evidence of his claim, and I don't know what form of evidence he would have available.</p>

13700,"<p>As you might see from my history I dont have a good relationship with my advisor. Recently we wrote a journal paper together based on my thesis. I wrote the introduction, analysis and the description of the app we had developed for our research. In crude terms, I wrote 15 pages of the 23 page journal paper. My advisor told me that she had submitted our draft to this journal three weeks ago, yet I never recieved any notification from the journal that I was listed as author or co-author. Now this is the journal: <a href=""http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/cfp/uehfcfp2.pdf"">Link to PDF</a>.</p>

<p>I went into the help section of the journal to figure if they do send emails to every author and it seems you do need an email to register as co-author. Confirmation <a href=""http://journalauthors.tandf.co.uk/pdfs/SubmitGuide_S1M_1.pdf"">here</a>. </p>

<p>According to the guidelines, if the co-author is not registered with the journal, his email should be provided. Its quite obvious I should have recieved an confirmation email and BTW my advisor only has my .edu email so there is no way she could have used another email address. I have written an journal paper to IEEE as co-author before and I had received an confirmatory email saying I was listed as co-author.  I am afraid of confronting my advisor about this as I need her to graduate and in my thesis defense. But I was curious to know if I will get an email if I am listed as co-author. And more importantly, should I be listed as author or co-author in this case, when the work is based on my thesis and I wrote most of the paper?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> So I called the 1800 number and when I told them the submitter's last name (my advisor) and the paper title, they confirmed that my advisor was listed as sole author. They told me that they had to unsubmit and resubmit the journal paper to add me as co-author and they gave me contact of an Univ. professor for further inquiries. I have all email proof of my work (for instance emails where my advisor asks me to write intro and I would reply with the intro text attached and so on). I am seriously upset right now. I have my thesis defense in December and I fear that if I confront my advisor, she will screw me up. Can you guys please advise on what I should do right now?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: So i was told that i am listed in Acknowledgement section in the end, which is completely unfair. The Deciding officer (it seems he is the final authority in these cases and RIO reports to him) at my Univ is the vice president, who was my advisor's PhD Advisor half a decade ago. They are both from same city of a foreign country and are close family friends. Rumor has it that the Vice President rejected multiple highly qualified candidates to get my advisor for Asst. Prof. Position.  All my friends are asking me to drop it because I dont have many bullets to go after them, but they can completely screw me up or set me up for something if I go against ""one of their own"". I am still evaluating what to do.</p>

<p>*<em>Edit 11/3/13: Thank you guys for all your advice. Even though I don't know any of you personally, you were very kind in giving me your time and advice. I cannot thank you all enough. I spoke with a full professor in another dept. in Engineering. He asked me to stay put till December until the paper is published. He was of opinion that the Univ is a big cesspool and they only way to clean it is to ""get the people"" who are doing this publicly and shame them. IDK if I am being used as pawn right now in University politics or what I should do. I  spoke with other people too and all they said was ""Is not getting an authorship on journal worth more than not earning the degree"". It seems sole authorship does carry extra weight age in front of tenure committee. The whole situation has completely shattered my faith in academics. And the fact that I am part of state university makes this even more depressing. And BTW one of the two editors of this journal was on advisor's PhD committee. So many people have advised me not to contact any of them. In academics everybody seems to know everybody, infact it seems more like a cult. I am just doing Masters now, I always had plans to do PhD and explore my curiosities and see what I can achieve with perseverance, hard work and to test my mental capabilities to their limit, but I am done. I quit. I never felt so depressed for a very long time. Academics these days seems to run by industry practitioners who had previous experience at corporate politics and are good at it or by businessman who wear good clothes, have good people skills and just show off while delegating all the work to GRAs and underlings.

13731,"<p>When you review papers submitted for publication, is there an “optimal” length for reviews?
In my experience as an author and referee, I have seen a large range of review lengths (for reference, a paper in my field is typically between 3 and 8 printed pages):</p>

<ul>
<li>Zero length: for some of the papers I have authored, the reviewer just clicked the “accept as is” or “reject” checkmark on the review sheet, without adding any comment (at least, not any comment visible to me). It's not so common, but it has happened.</li>
<li>Short length: a lot of time, I received reviews who consisted of a single paragraph.</li>
<li>Medium: one full page, maybe two pages.</li>

In my case, <strong>it's <em>almost surely appropriate</em> to send the e-mail (since my adviser suggested it)</strong>, I'm just wandering as to <strong>what is the best way to formulate such an e-mail</strong>.</p>

<h3>The situation</h3>

<p>The situation is that there is this bigshot researcher in my field, who designed an experimental framework that is very widely used (which I want to use now). In the paper describing the framework (not so recent, ~2005), he compares 5 (then) state-of-the-art methods, and those 5 are still used as comparison references.
The problem is that, even though implementations for the reference methods are provided, I can not find the parameters used to initialize the method.</p>

<p>It is stated in the paper that the parameters suggested by original authors of the methods are used, but, after weeks of digging through the framework paper, papers introducing the method for the first time, and even trying to guess the parameters so they match the ones used, I still <em>can not get the ones used</em>. Since I want to test the method with slight modifications and not just use it as reference, I can not re-use the implementation provided but instead need to run my implementation with <em>parameters I can not find</em>, and introduce modifications to that.</p>

<h3>In short</h3>

<p>So, to <strong>summarize and generalize:</strong> After a few weeks of looking for it, I <strong>can not find some parameters</strong> used in a (seminal framework) work published in 2005. These parameters are <strong>not needed to reproduce</strong> the work, but <strong>are important in extending it</strong>. My adviser suggested <strong>e-mailing the author of the paper</strong> (who is a well known in the community), but since he is so well know and I'm a lowly PhD student <strong>I feel kind of uncomfortable sending this e-mail.</strong></p>

<h3>The question</h3>

<p>I do understand that this is probably the best (and possibly only) approach to getting the information I need, even if it is not very probable that it will work. With that (and my fear of bigshot academics) in mind, my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to best write such an email? Besides the basics (be polite and concise) I don't know where to even start.</li>

13751,"<p>all. I'm an early PhD student and one of my research foci is conservation biology. Of the various focal topics of my research, this is the one that I feel most passionate about. (And within conservation biology, habitat loss/disruption is the issue that holds the highest degree of intrinsic interest for me.) However, like many in conservation bio I am somewhat dismayed by what I see as a lack of actual impact stemming from conservation research -- that is to say, a lot of research gets done but not a lot actually changes because of it.</p>

<p>I realize that environmental policy is a huge issue that extends way beyond the bounds of academic research, and that the challenges of enacting science-based policy are many and are often seen as being best left to policymakers and policy advocates rather than researchers. However, I am finding that I am increasingly interested in charting a career path that puts me in a place where I can work to bridge the divide between research and policy, where I have a chance of making conservation bio a more effective field in terms of real-world results (even if my part in such an effort is a small one) and where I can ideally be involved both with doing impactful, effective research and also with seeing the results of that research be put into action.</p>

<p>My question is this: what would that career path look like? My goal up to now has been to try for a professorship in academia (as insane as that job market is these days) or else in the statistically likely event that I don't make it there to look for a similar research-oriented job, perhaps with a museum or with the government. I'm still in the first year of my PhD, so this plan is still pretty hazy but that's the general outline of it at the moment. I realize I have a long way to go (at least another four years of PhD work and a postdoc or two) before I'm in a position to take a shot at becoming a PI, but I think it's important to have at least a rough idea of what the ultimate end is. Looking realistically at the PhD program I'm in, I think I have as good a shot as anyone at ""making it"".</p>

<p>I'm becoming less sure though that that path (what I think of as the ""traditional"" career path for PhD students in the sciences) is one that will necessarily put me in a position where I can have a hand in conservation policy and in shaping the direction of my field, which are goals that are becoming increasingly important to me. I know that there are ways to do research that is more impactful (I found this article very edifying:  <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/publication/236190887_Achieving_Conservation_Science_that_Bridges_the_Knowledge-Action_Boundary/file/504635178e8cfe5a13.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Cook et al 2013, Achieving Conservation Science that Bridges the Knowledge-Action Boundary</a> [PDF]) but I don't feel that impactful research is really incentivized by the systems of reward and prestige that prevail in academic research, such that putting too much of a focus on actionable research can actually be detrimental to one's career.</p>

<p>I'm trying to think outside the box a little bit now, to get a sense of what trajectory I should be putting myself on if I want to do more ""meaningful"" conservation work while still using the research background that I am developing in my PhD program. I love research. I love doing science, and I even love working in academia as crazy as it sometimes can be. I'm not committed to the idea of a high salary (not that professors normally make a particularly high salary) though I would like to do something that gives me a modicum of financial security at a modest standard of living. I'm not averse to working in academia, or in government, or for an NGO or a private corporation or anywhere else as long as I can be connected to research and have the opportunity to turn conservation research into conservation action. I just want to do research (or at least be involved with research in a way that lets me put my skills to good use) that actually makes a difference out in the world.</p>

<p>Do any of you have any suggestions for career tracks that I should look into? Perhaps you yourself are already in a job that you feel has the characteristics that I am looking for? Maybe you are able to offer me a new perspective on academia that will allay my reservations about a lack of impactfulness in my hypothetical future work there? Or perhaps you see opportunities for researchers of any stripe to make important contributions to the work of conservation management and policymaking from whatever role they may end up in, by being advocates or advisors or activists outside of the lab?</p>

<p>All kinds of advice would be appreciated. Reading material, personal anecdotes, and any resources or tips or insights you have will all be welcome. Thanks for taking the time to read and think about my question.</p>

We had two rounds of revisions, and following detailed suggestions from one reviewer, we have improved our proposed algorithm a lot: its complexity is now significantly lower, and the idea he suggested makes the overall method more robust in handling noisy signal.</p>

<ul>
<li>In my cover letter for the revised manuscript, explain the situation to the editor and ask him if he could (with the reviewer's agreement) lift anonymity and allow the authors' list change.</li>
<li>Wait for the manuscript to be formally approved, and only then write to the editor asking for the same thing.</li>
<li>Do nothing, for example because it is frowned upon. This would pain me greatly, because the reviewer really contributed very significantly to the algorithm, and I believe he should be able to claim authorship for this contribution (if he sees it fit).</li>

<p>I am reviewing a paper that appears to report a well-conducted empirical study, with proper data analysis. The results of the article are interesting and relevant for the journal.</p>

<p>However, I am very concerned with how the paper was written. I will provide some of my concerns of the report here:</p>

<p>Besides many grammatical errors - which I forgive as English is not my main language as well - the article is badly structured and often confusing. It fails to clearly state the research questions. No all the hypotheses are well supported by the literature review. It omits several key studies in the literature review. It often makes strong claims without a proper reference. It often fails to quantify stuff, falling to the tedious ""a lot"", ""many"", ""few"", ""circa"", etc. It is quite mysterious on certain aspects of the research design-e.g., a control group is suddenly mentioned without really clarifying what constituted the control group, and the paper reports that the experiment is not even a controlled experiment.</p>

<p>In sum, <em>for the first sections</em> I have nearly a comment for each of the manuscript paragraphs. I will do my best as a reviewer. I will provide all possible suggestions for improving the manuscript. Whereas I am confident that the results of the study are interesting, and that the research design is sound, I don't know if failing to clearly write the manuscript is a reason for suggesting rejection or for recommending major revisions.</p>

<p>Where is the line in this case? The journal does not clarify this in its reviewer guidelines.</p>

<p>In case of suggesting a major revision, what if the authors still fail to provide a clearly written and organized manuscript in a second round? Could I still request for major revisions?</p>

I have not received a response from my professor yet; my guess is that she is hesitant to agree to this exception for several reasons. One, is the notion that I might have some kind of advantage over the rest of the class. Second, should my professor make modifications to the exam (e.g. change problems, make it harder) for my exam, then she may argue that the other students' exams will have to be graded differently from mine, and that's unfair. Third, the exam is scheduled at the normal class time, 10:00 AM - 10:50 AM, so it can be argued that if a student attends class regularly at those times, then there is no reason why the student should need to take the exam at a different time. </p>

<p>My professor hasn't said any of the above (yet) and I don't read minds; this is just my best guess of what she will think of my request.

<p>The question at hand is whether we should offer sample solutions to all our exercises for, e.g., a Data Structures &amp; Algorithms lecture.
I am convinced that this would be a highly beneficial service for our students whereas my advisor is against it. Here are the pros and cons that we came up with:</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Students have access to high-quality answers when they don't understand something.</p></li>
<li><p>Our expectations on verboseness, conciseness, depth of proofs, etc. can be communicated more clearly.</p></li>
<li><p>A student can individually study using the solutions and is not forced to attend the tutorials if this is not his preferred style of learning</p></li>
<li><p>We (the professor/tutor) have a clearer idea of what solutions to expect since we have to work the problems ourselves.</p></li>
<li><p>The tutor (me) is more free in the design of the tutorial. Without sample solutions, the tutorial basically boils down to writing the sample solutions on the blackboard. Otherwise I can't be sure that everyone has at least seen the correct way how to solve it. Little interaction is involved.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It costs time and/or money.</p></li>
<li><p>Students may stop being engaged in the exercises since they know they can always look at the sample solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Students may stop coming to the tutorials.</p></li>
<li><p>We can't reuse exercises from past years since students might have access to (and use) past sample solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>If we do it once, the students might expect we do it for every lecture.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To be clear, in both cases the students are expected to solve the exercise sheets on their own, and they will be graded. I'm merely interested in what to offer <em>after</em> this has happened.</p>

<p>I think that's all. Optimally, I would like to find some kind of empirical study that proves that sample solutions increase the ""productivity"" of students. Data always wins. However, so far I couldn't find anything like this.</p>

<p>To discuss the points mentioned above, my general opinion on these matters is that if we can offer more services using little work, we should always do it. If someone really misuses it (as stated in the cons), he or she will notice that this is the wrong approach the latest in the exams. My advisor, however, wants to minimize the time spent on lectures and have me rather do the research relevant to my PhD. Since I have to do the solutions anyway, the overhead for providing a sample solution is maybe 2-3 hours/week.</p>

14073,"<p>SLO stands for student learning outcome. At the community college where I teach, what seems to have happened is that our accrediting body told us we had to have them, and since they effectively wield the death penalty over us, we complied. Administrators may also have bought into the idea at some point.</p>

<p>What is the history of SLOs? Is there any published, intellectually rigorous justification for them?</p>

<p>I'm inclined to be extremely skeptical of them. They seem to be an incompetently executed type of standardized testing, without any of the scientific rigor that has been built up over a century of development of the field of psychometrics. In particular, standardized tests are supposed to be both <em>valid</em> and <em>reliable</em>. A typical SLO is probably not valid (because it tests too small a subset of the subject matter) and not reliable (because it is too short an instrument to produce a result with a reasonable variance). We could fix these problems, and then we would have ... a professionally developed standardized test. E.g., in my field, physics, we would have something like the AP physics test, the physics portion of the MCATs, or the physics GRE.</p>

<p>Administrators and accrediting bodies seem to believe that SLOs could be used, for example, to measure whether a particular educational innovation has been successful. The problem here is that one then has to interpret the <em>difference</em> between one set of test scores and another set of test scores, but the difference between two low-reliability (high-variance) numbers is essentially meaningless. This is also a problem that plagues ""value added"" measurements (Baker 2010), but it would be far more severe for SLOs because of their far lower reliability.</p>

<p>Arum 2011 (p. 140) discusses this sort of thing in the context of the seepage of NCLB-style testing from K-12 into higher education. They discuss the Spellings Commission report (Spellings 2006) as an influential document, although I think the fad for SLOs began to get underway before 2006, and the report suggested standardized tests such as the CLA, rather than what people now refer to as SLOs. A disgruntled member of the commission (Zemsky 2011) says that in retrospect the main outcome was to transform accreditation from a pro forma exercise into an audit-like procedure designed to give the federal government coercive power over colleges and universities.</p>

<p>Is the whole thing a Dilbertish emperor's-new-clothes exercise, or is there some intellectually rigorous case to be made for SLOs?</p>

I took GIS courses and started tinkering around with code and figured out CS was my calling. I am currently taking classes at my local community college to get an AS in CS that I am hoping to transfer to somewhere that offers a BS. I have no regrets because I am in a job I love and take class half-time while I work.
I think that I will be done with it in about 1.5 to 2 years as it is about 27 credit hours and I am taking about 7-8 a semester (fall, spring, and summer). It may take me closer to the 2 because I want to retake calculus and physics (as the college requires) since I took them 10 years ago as an 18-year old and barely skated by. Most BS requirements in CS require 2 calc classes and one physics class. It looks like my local universities can accept them being taken from community college as long as the AS was earned. I just would rather be safe than sorry.</p>

<p>Here is the catch though, I probably need to do it online since I also want to work while in school and will likely be moving out of my state when my SO finishes medical residency in 2017.</p>

14115,"<p>These days, most of the conferences I attend provide their proceedings on a USB stick, or online only. Yet at the same time they have a strict page limit, which is usually set to something between 4 and 8 pages. I'm curious about the rationale for such a small limit. This is probably something that varies between fields, although I've experienced it in more than one field myself (subfields of artificial intelligence and physics). It doesn't seem particularly limited to big conferences.</p>

<p>I realise that super-long papers would hard on the reviewers, who have to do a lot of work for a large conference. But on the other hand, a very short paper will have to leave out a lot of background and important information, which at best will make it difficult to read, and at worst will make it impossible to judge on its merits. It's also a lot more effort to write a four-page paper than a 10-page one, unless you happen to be presenting a single experimental result using an established methodology (which is rarely if ever the case in artificial intelligence and related fields).</p>

<p>Looking at conference proceedings from the 1950s through to the early 1980s, it seems that proceedings papers were generally much longer. As an extreme example, I know of <a href=""http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/stand.on.entropy.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">one</a> that's over 100 pages (it's quite a famous paper and the length seems worth it), but up to 20 pages doesn't seem uncommon. In the '90s the standard seems to have been 10 pages, at least in subfields of computer science. Although there's obviously selection bias involved, these old papers don't seem particularly longer than they need to be, and their length allows them to make rather deeper points than could be made in a modern 4-page paper.</p>

<p>I'd like to know the reasoning behind short page limits at conferences. Is there a school of thought that says these extreme limits lead to better-quality papers, and/or less work for the reviewers? Or is it just a holdover from the recent past, when big conferences were expected to provide a paper proceedings to every participant, who would then have to carry the whole thing home?</p>

Here is my story, I am seriously thinking of doing a 2nd PhD in Computer Science because I want to eventually own an Algorithmic Energy Trading Firm and need to become an expert in Machine Learning algorithms.  I currently work as an Aerospace Engineer for the Department of Defense for nearly 6 years now and here is my academic background: </p>

<p>B.Sc. Mechanical Engineering from University of Maryland College Park, GPA: 3.1.
M.Sc. Aerospace Engineering from University of Maryland College Park, GPA: 3.5.
Ph.D. Aerospace Engineering from University of Maryland College Park, GPA: 3.8.</p>

<p>Because I was not serious as an undergraduate student, I was only able to attain admission into the Aerospace Engineering department at Maryland because I took some Aerospace courses, did really well and a professor on the admission committee greatly assisted in securing my admission.  The Aerospace Engineering department at UMD is usually ranked Top 10 in the country and is currently ranked #11.  Thus, I am fairly proud of having acquired a PhD from such a highly ranked Aerospace program in the country.  In addition to working on my Doctorate these past several years, I was also working full-time as an Aerospace Engineer and it was a great challenge that I purposefully undertook to prove something to myself.</p>

<p>As of now, I am working on a few journal papers to publish and I am not going to have any problems getting strong letters of recommendation from my employer and professors on campus.  I ought to be able to get a letter from the Dean of my college as well.  So, I am thinking of a second PhD in Computer Science because I really want to immerse myself in Machine Learning and figured a PhD was the way to go.</p>

<p>Question for everyone:  Would it be a challenge for me to acquire entrance into a top 5 school in Computer Science for a PhD?</p>

For instance, a colleague of mine recently gave a presentation and before each section she'd have a slide with just the title of the section and a photo (e.g. ""Methods"" and a picture of her lab equipment). I liked that because it structures the presentation and is a nice break from charts, diagrams and (in the worst case) bullet points.

14459,"<p>Prior to submitting a Journal article, I had a conversation with my supervisor about whether it was suitable for a letter (max 4 pages) or a more detailed article (max 12 pages). My position was that the core contribution (a new method) could be concisely and completely be described in less than 4 pages, and should therefore be a letter. The complication was that some progress had been made on the application of the method to a particular problem.</p>

<p>I therefore wanted to publish the first letter straight away, and later publish a second letter later dealing with the application. My supervisor didn't like this idea. He said it was ""playing the game"" to increase one's own H-index, and it was more suited to a single article. I subsequently took his advice to submit a full length article. However, now (with the article submitted over 3 months ago, and still under editorial review) he has changed his mind and says it's ""up to me"" as to whether I would like to withdraw it and resubmit as 2 letters...</p>

14529,"<p>I am a relatively young faculty member. I was asked to provide a reference for a student of mine so he is admitted in a PhD program in Sciences in UK. The student is probably one of the best students I had in a couple of years in terms of academic potential. I firmly believe he will do well as he is bright and hard-working. </p>

<p>I have to fill in an online form rating him. My problem is that the form's scaling is very strong.
How can I honestly say that someone was <code>outstanding</code> (3%) and not <code>exceptional</code> (1%)? Even the third most positive option is <code>unusually good</code> (rated at 10%) which I feel as a characterization in itself should be <em>strong enough</em> for someone to be at least considered for a PhD.  </p>

<p>My classes are never above 40 to 45 students and I believe that simply ""lumping"" all the students from my past couple of years in one sample is ineffective and unreasonable. I would probably be unable to single out one of my students as the single best student I've ever had so that I can place him in the top 1% interval with certainty and not top 3%.</p>

<p>As I said, I want to support him and I worry that simply putting him down as <code>outstanding</code> would harm him as other referees might be tempted to ""max out"" everything. On the other hand simply rating him as <code>exceptional</code> in almost all aspects would be just grade-inflation.</p>

<p>Could someone provide me with some advice on the matter and what they would do? The scaling I have come across before topped at 5% which I found reasonable but here this not the case.</p>

<p>One knows that there is inflation in the field, so they feel they have to adapt, but it is not clear how much inflation is appropriate and when it is too much. Negative comments are often omitted, and this gives the evaluators less data.</p>

<p>There is an analogous problem when refereeing papers, or serving as anonymous referees for research proposals and grants. This seems to be a flaw which is implicit in the evaluation method. Apart from this voluntary inflation bias, there is also an involuntary component: if I ask you to evaluate your research field/colleague/student is, you will unconsciously feel biased towards it/him/her.</p>

<p><strong>Is this perceived as a big problem?</strong> If so, <strong>why is there no attempt to obtain more reliable results?</strong> Some possible strategies, although difficult to apply, spring to my mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if there are enough data points for the recommender, normalize everything and ""grade on a curve"".</p></li>
<li><p>don't ask ""how good X is?""; give them two paper/applicants/projects to evaluate, and ask ""which one is better, X or Y?"". This makes it more difficult to find good referees, because they have to be familiar with two of the persons/projects under evaluations.</p></li>
<li><p>force the evaluators to provide at least 3 positive and 3 negative points, the most outstanding ones. This won't affect the inflation bias, but at least it provides some more data on the negative aspects.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have seriously considered writing a standard addendum to enclose to my letters and reports, stating that I realize how biased and unreliable these things are, I am in a difficult position giving an absolute score on a scale that is totally unknown to me and the other evaluators, and I'd really feel more comfortable with a comparison-based evaluation system. <strong>Would this be appropriate, or raise some eyebrows on the trustworthyness of my evaluations</strong>?</p>

He is a very good <em>student</em>, but struggles with one of the realities of being an astronomer - coding. Right now, he is just running code others have written, but despite my strong suggestion that he start learning the language, still asks for my help on even the most elementary of problems. His confidence in using computers is lacking, and if he continues in the field it will become a serious hindrance.</p>

<p>I did provide a very high level of assistance early on, but this was mostly due to a couple of bugs in setting my own code up on his computer. In later stages of this research project, he is going to need to write some basic code of his own, so I feel we're getting to the stage where we need to establish a greater level of independence. </p>

It is the job of a mentor and supervisor to <em>assist</em> in that, but I feel that my mentee still feels entitled that I should solve his problems for him (I only solved ""his"" problems before because a bug in code that I wrote is <em>my</em> responsibility).

It is not an academic position per se, but is led by a few principal investigators who are full professors.

I can understand creating a maximum word-count (this makes students sift out what they feel is relevant to answering the prompt of the paper) whereas a minimum word-count encourages one to think more broadly about how to go about the prompt. In some situations this is good -- perhaps the instructor expects evidence or more critical thinking -- but in most situations this will only lead students to find more evidence to reaffirm their claim (which is not very useful if you can prove your claim with less evidence) or create ""fluff"" in their paper in order to meet the requirement.</p>

14706,"<p>After I completed my PhD program, during which I published one refereed paper, I applied for several academic positions.
For a while, my two main thesis advisers agreed to write letters of recommendation, but after a few couple of years, one of them told me he would no longer recommend me because I had not published enough. He even admitted that it was not his job to judge my publication record -- potential employers could do that -- but until I published again, he wouldn't recommend me.</p>

<p>I do admit that I should have published more during my PhD program, but I was always under the impression that my publishing would begin after I had got a relevant job. During the period between graduation and being refused a recommendation, I'd been a consultant, a college teacher and unemployed. I could have published on my own but, after the delay, I felt hindered by being unemployed and rather ""burned out"" after the thesis writing process. Catch-22? Even more ironic is the fact that I had asked my thesis advisers if I could submit my thesis in the form of a series of published papers (this was allowed under the rules), instead of as an unpublished monograph, and both said no!</p>

<p>Don't thesis advisers have a duty to both encourage candidates to publish and to recommend them for academic positions?

Or do you see your prior reading of the paper as totally irrelevant and just approach the review fresh and as normal?</li>
<li>From the strategic perspective of the authors of the paper, is it better to ask for comments from people who you know are likely to be asked later to review the paper?

<p>For example, writing wise (clarity, concision, etc.), my strongest writing sample is on a topic that was written for a course in my field (Art History) but is still relatively tangential to the field itself (about visuality rather than Art History per se). That being said, topic wise, I have a paper that was written on the same topic as my fourth years honours thesis (still a work in progress) that speaks to the areas that I want to continue studying. It is still a good piece of work that received an A grade, but I personally feel that the writing and organization is weaker.</p>

<p>Which is better to send as a writing sample? The more on topic, but weaker piece, or the stronger tangentially-related piece.</p>

<p>My adviser has two funding project in his hand. One is a cellphone project and another one is a Darpa project. In the beginning, I worked with a cellphone project. This project is something plan to be commercialized and funding by private investors. There were two people mainly working on this cellphone project, me and my friend. We both have separated funding from different sources to work on this project. After I had finish the project ( 6 months), I was moved to work in the Darpa project, with another team. My friend who I worked with in a cellphone project is still working in the final part and marketing it (also continue to find money from investors). </p>

<p>One day, my cellphone-project friend's funding were all gone ( he started this work one year before me). His fund is about two years and he cannot find the investors to put more money in his cellphone. Then this is my problem because I am not a main person in both the cellphone and the Darpa project. My adviser want to move my money to support my friend and want me to quit (because no need for my programming skill anymore, programming part is done). He started by telling me that I watched YouTube in the lab. (He did see me once that I listened to the music while I was programming). He told me that no one in the lab watch YouTube, everybody just read paper for relaxing. (All of my friends watch YouTube and Facebook, trust me). Then he continued with I am not eager to improve me code and make it faster. He told me that all PhD, researcher will eager to make it very fast. ( I programmed something is called SIFT and the speed is the best I can do, due to the nature of the algorithm ).. Anyway, 3 months ago he told me the speed is good enough for this work, that's why I didn't improve it. He told me that I have a problem in communication ( I asked him could you give me some examples about the communication problem, then he changed the topics). </p>

<p>Since I am holding J1 visa, If he kicked me out, I have to go back with nothing. I feel this is very unfair. When he asked me to work, it is very nice. However when I completed the work, he want to kick me out and get the money back. I have no idea what to do? What should I do after this? I feel really bad about my adviser.</p>

15067,"<p>I'm wondering whether dismissal / withdrawal from a PhD program should be listed as disciplinary action on subsequent applications. A Master's program application usually asks questions like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have you ever been found responsible for a disciplinary violation at any post-secondary institution you have attended, whether related to academic misconduct or behavioral misconduct, that resulted in a disciplinary action?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was academically dismissed from a PhD program after four semesters for not being able to maintain the minimum GPA.  I plan to fully include this information in my application (e.g. through transcripts from the institution from which I was dismissed), and address why I was dismissed (and what steps I have taken to address academic concerns) in my Statement of Purpose.  However, I am not sure if my dismissal counts as one that is due to ""disciplinary violation"" related to ""academic misconduct or behavioral misconduct"".  I was simply dismissed due to not being able to maintain the required grades. Should I answer the above question in the negative?</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>After completing my Bachelor's degree, I began full-time work in the field.
While working I decided to attempt a PhD program in a unrelated field.</p>

<p>I started in the program, while continuing to work full time. Due to some poor time management skills, study skills, and personal issues, I could not maintain the minimum academic requirements. I was dismissed from the program after 4 semesters, because I received 3 C grades (the program's requirement is no more than 2 C grades). I had by that time taken my prelim exams, and passed some but not others.
With this dismissal I can not be readmitted by at that univerity.</p>

<p>After this, I took 2 classes at at another university in order to improve my grades so I can apply to Masters programs.  I expect to do OK in these courses. I am currently in the process of applying to Master's programs in the area.</p>

<ol>
<li>There are very few math majors in the program. I suffer and feel the lack of peers.</li>
<li>Professors are extremely friendly. They work on harmonic analysis, representation theory, Fourier analysis, analytic number theory, functional analysis, category theory, game theory and C* algebra. However, we don't have people working in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory and other areas.</li>
<li>At the end of four years, I can at best get courses in real analysis (in one and several variables), complex analysis, general topology, discrete mathematics, analytic NT, ODE and PDE, linear algebra, groups, rings, fields and other courses from the research interests of my professors.</li>
<li>To get an Honors degree, I'll additionally write a Bachelor's thesis.</li>
<li>There are two other places in our country (Let's call them B) which are really good- their programs are tougher, they offer more grad courses, have the best peer group, etc.,have some of the best researchers in the country, cost much less. To move to B, I will have to sit for an admission test and start afresh.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, they do not have a provision for Bachelor's thesis and are 3 year programs.</p>

<p>My primary concerns are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Since I want to apply to the top universities in the US, I feel not getting courses like differential geometry, algebraic geometry, algebraic topology at my current institution A will severely affect my application. But I will write a Bachelor's thesis.</p></li>
<li><p>If I move to B, not writing a bachelor's thesis will make my application weaker as I will have no proper independent project or something like that to show my research potential but I will get grad level courses.</p></li>

Jobs are generally announced in one place (jobs.ac.uk) and the interview date is often set in advance.

Why don't search committees set a date for the short list to be decided at the outset and make it publicly available? Even for searches that move sequentially through the short list inviting candidates one at a time for interviews, could still send out a notification.

So this question is to ask about the ethics directly.</p>

<p>Suppose I have written and published a textbook, and I want to use it as the text for a course I am teaching.  I receive royalties from each copy of my book that is sold, so if my students are required to buy my textbook for the course, I will make some money.  <strong>Is it ethical to do so?</strong></p>

<p>Well-reasoned opinions would be useful answers, but even more useful would be pointers to institutional policies, professional codes of ethics, etc, that address this issue.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many ways to avoid profiting from the sale of my book to my students.  If my contract with my publisher allows it, I could distribute PDFs to my students, or have the university bookstore print out copies and sell them at cost.  Another approach I've heard of is to compute how much I earn in royalties on each copy, and refund that amount from my pocket to each student who buys a copy.  Or, use my royalty earnings to buy pizza for the class.  Certainly these are nice gestures, but I would like opinions on whether they are ethically required.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: To address some questions that have arisen in the comments:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This question is hypothetical.  I haven't published any textbooks myself and have no immediate plans to do so.  In any case, my personal preference would be to make the book available to students for free, if at all possible.  So I've phrased this question in the first person for rhetorical convenience only.</p></li>
<li><p>I had intended the question to be only about the potential financial conflict of interest that could arise if I make money by assigning my own book.  Some of the answers feel that it is improper for me to assign my own textbook at all, whether I make money or not, but I don't think this point of view is prevalent within the academic community.  If it happens that my book (as a pithy but now-deleted comment put it) ""blows"", I think most would agree that my decision to assign it is pedagogically unfortunate, but not unethical.  </p></li>
<li><p>I don't literally mean that students would be <em>required to buy</em> the book, only that they'd be expected to have it.  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them, but they could certainly achieve this by getting a used copy or borrowing from a friend.  But probably most students would buy new copies anyway, since that is the most convenient way.</p></li>

<p>An aspect of a life as a postdoc that I had never considered before is the following: what is your social life outside of academia like as a postdoc?</p>

<p>As a PhD student, I had a very tight group of friends; we were friends from day 1 in graduate school, and that friendship continued throughout. Our friendship strengthened by going through many difficult classes together, staying up all night finishing homework, and studying for quals together, not to mention talking about how much it blows to be a PhD student, and worrying about the job market.</p>

<p>I feel that I will not have this privilege as a postdoc. We are all there to do our jobs (i.e. research), and I do not see building the same kind of camaraderie amongst the newly-hired postdocs, for these reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>there are no excuses to spend a ton of time with one another (no homework, no quals to study for, etc.)</li>
<li>we will likely have different research areas, and possibly have nothing in common to talk about in terms of academics.</li>
<li>there are way fewer postdocs than there are graduate students. I would be lucky to have maybe three or four other postdocs hired with me by my department. Maybe we would get along, maybe we would not. I do not have the luxury of choosing the people that I like anymore.</li>
<li>at least some postdocs must have family. I have found that married people are less likely to yearn for a close friendship. This narrows down the possibilities for friends even more (not that I would discriminate against married people, but they often dissociate themselves from, say, a late-night out of fun).</li>

<p>In particular, if such scenario happens, and if I want to prevent the first point, what do I need to do? I am wary of contacting the departments, because should the department be excited about me, and should someone push for my being hired in the hiring committee meeting, then I would feel obligated (to some degree) to accept that offer (even if a better offer comes along), since that someone has advocated on my behalf, on my request.</p>

15239,"<p>The current system of producing knowledge in academia, think-tanks, research laboratories funded by large organizations, and similar has the benefits that there is usually some oversight, the people involved have been trained on how to conduct and contribute to research, and how to communicate their results to the literate portion of the society they are supposed to aid.  (The above is subject to debate, but I prefer to assume it for the purpose of the question below.)</p>

<p>How can a person with no contacts to any of these contribute, or learn how to contribute, to the production of research, in spite of lack of oversight, funding, and training?  As examples, a person who finds an alternate and faster method of DNA replication, or finds influences of Jane Austen among current bloggers that suggest a certain societal trend, or has a new way of analyzing large portions of astronomical data, or finds a way of speeding up numerical simulations of models of biological systems involving capillary blood flow.  How does such a person present such an idea or method?</p>

<p>One can write to authors on the appropriate area; how likely is this to succeed?  One could look at an appropriate journal, attempt to copy the style, formatting, and phraseology of the articles and then submit their write-up to that journal, but without affiliation; with what result?  One might attempt to use the Internet to strike up conversations with like-minded individuals and find a willing ear and eye; are there enough willing ears and eyes?  One could start a blog or just put up a web page announcing the work; I have done that, but I have too many connections to be considered a complete outsider to academia, and I want to pose the question for those who are so outside.  Further, how could someone searching an index find that page among many that are computer generated using similar phrases?</p>

<p>There are several spins one can put on this.  Let us further assume that the primary goal is to present the idea/form of knowledge, and receive little or no more than the recognition of making the contribution and the satisfaction of seeing it used.  In particular, potential degrees, awards, or jobs are not part of the scenario or motivation.  In this day and age, would blogging be enough?  Also, for fun and to make answers less trivial, assume the outsider is not and is not likely to enroll in a university.</p>

<p>Added: To address a comment, enrolling in a university would likely provide many of the desired contacts, but with some cost.  The outsider may have had a university education, but this question makes the assumption that contacts there are stale or otherwise not accessible or appropriate, making this person more of an outsider.</p>

15279,"<p>As written in the title, I'm thinking of applying for masters in Europe (I myself am from Serbia), but I made a mess of my undergraduate career, so I'm looking for advice how to present this in my CV and SOP.</p>

<p><strong>Here's my background:</strong></p>

<p>Back after finishing high school, I applied for a relatively well respected local electrical engineering school (University of Belgrade School of Electrical Engineering). Out of 500 students, I was 250ish. So far so good. My intent at the time was to study computer engineering.</p>

<p>Then came the first academic year. I passed a number of exams (mostly those I could pass with no studying at all, so as a result my grades were pretty bad, with my grade average being 7.0 out of 10, with 6 being passing grade), but I didn't have enough credits pass to the second year.<br>
No big deal, I thought, since statistics show that the four year program there usually lasts around seven years, with first year being the most difficult. I took some exams from the second year and tried to pass first year exams again. At the end of the year, I passed none of the first year exams, but I did pass some of the second year exams. Third time's the charm I thought, got some more second year exams and tried to pass the first year again. At the end of the year, situation was the same as last time: I passed none of the problematic first year exams, but I did pass some of the second year exams.<br>
By that time, I was pretty depressed, had gained quite a bit of weight, was having big problems with procrastination and was fed up with school politics. </p>

<p>At that point I decided that it was time to switch schools. I moved to a younger, less-respected school (Union University School of Computing) and got admitted (barely) into second year there due to exams I passed at my previous school. I moved to a telecommunications study program there. </p>

<p>In the second year, at my new school, I had around one and a half year worth of exams, but I managed to pass them. The downside was that my grades weren't all that good. They weren't bad, but nothing exceptional either. Third year went well for me. I passed all of the exams, raised my average grade to 8.0 out of 10 and became one of the best students in my (relatively small) class. In one particularly hard exam I was the only student that year to get a 9 with nobody getting a 10.</p>

<p>Right now, the exam season for the winter semester of my fourth year is approaching and I'm thinking of what I'm going to do next. I've spoken to few professors and they all believe that I should definitely continue my education. I wouldn't have any problems continuing my education at my current school, but I don't think that it's best equipped for the field in which I want to study further. The focus of my current school is computer science, while the telecommunications program seems to have taken a back seat. </p>

<p>I have read the question about getting a Ph.D. with bad transcript and fortunately for me course structure was such that just a few professors taught a large number of exams (for example six to eight hours every day for the whole semester with same professor and TA), so there are people who know me well and have a good opinion of me. </p>

<p>I don't think that I could do much to improve my average grade. Perhaps the best I could do would be around 8.3 out of 10. </p>

<p>I don't think that I would have any problems with IELTS exam and I do think that I could prepare GRE well enough. I do understand that good grades there won't help me much, but on the other hand I at least hope that they won't have a negative effect. </p>

<p>I'm thinking of applying for universities that aren't very highly ranked, for example some from the bottom of the top 200 from the Shanghai list, but I'm not sure if that's low enough. Also I'm thinking of applying for two-year masters, but I'm coming from a four-year undergraduate school, if that matters. </p>

<p><strong>Finally my question:</strong></p>

<p>What I really don't know is how to present me dropping out of my first school in my CV or SOP. I've been basically studying 6 years now, much longer than expected, with not that good grades and I really can't think of any way to present that in favorable light. I think that I matured in the meantime and my grades did improve, but on the other hand I moved a weaker school.  </p>

15306,"<p>Here is the thing. I am working in an lab under a new assistant professor of HCI and our lab itself is just 2 years old. We had an MS student graduating earlier and I am the 2nd Masters student from the lab to have finished my dissertation and we also have an PHD Candidate working in there. So at present we are just 2 GRAs in the lab.
To help us out with some programming, we hired 2 students on an hourly basis. My advisor is not into micromanagement. She hires the students and asks for an update just a week before deadline and places heavy trust on people working for her and till now it has worked fine.</p>

<p>I was asked to manage this student, and this guy is severely incompetent to say the least. He showed my advisor an app he had developed with 4 other students as an undergrad project to back up his skills, although I highly doubt if he did any work on that project. When we asked him to program an app , he could not do it so he went to another lab and made their GRAs develop the app for him .The code was so horrible that I had to rewrite the whole program just before the deadline. I brought this to my advisor's attention and she said she will fire both of them and asked me to stay back for one semester to help her out with transition.</p>

<p>I am pretty good at what I do and have a stellar reputation in my department. Despite multiple requests from my advisor ,I said I don't want to spend one more semester in the lab, and I can earn more by getting an job.</p>

<p>What my advisor doesn't know is that when he(the new guy) was working , instead of developing the app on the tablet, he installed games on it and kept the tablet in his home for 1 month. This caused some hardships to the other new hire in the lab and she could not complete her programs on time. Whenever I asked him to return the tablet , he would say he came to lab but nobody was there (when we were actually there the whole time). I was busy with interviews so I never bothered to tell my advisor about this.</p>

<p>At end of December, and out of desperation she hired this student (the guy she said she will fire) and that guy sensing desperation asked her for GRA, saying he is interested in dissertation. My advisor agreed reluctantly. I came to know about this only last week when I called him as to what he was doing in break. He sheepishly told me that my advisor was a fool and he was not interested in thesis but only in getting a free ride through college though an GRA.</p>

<p>I am worried he will not do any work , pay other people to write programs and dissertation for him. One black apple can destroy the work environment in lab. So I finally emailed my advisor and asked her if she can promise me an full time job by April, I will stay back and help her out in research. I have also asked her for an appointment to discuss an important matter (this matter being the new student).</p>

<p>I think my advisor has already given him the commitment, but how can I convince her to drop the student? I have worked in my lab for 1.5 years. I deeply care about it, and I don't want that student in there. What will be best way to approach my advisor about this?</p>

<p><em>UPDATE:  So i spoke with my advisor yesterday and told her in no uncertain terms that she is not into  micromanagement and this guy will screw up her lab after i leave , she will never realize it  and he will pay somebody else to write thesis for her and her career will be on the hook.I promised her if she gets me her best student from class , i will teach them how to do basics of programming so that there will be smooth transition once i leave.So according to that new guy, she asked him to meet and told him that she has no funding and it will be difficult for him to do thesis without funding and asked him to try other departments.She asked him to meet her after an week. Kind of indirectly telling him to leave i guess.
What i am not able to understand is when asked my adviser yesterday she  told me that she never offered asked the guy to do thesis with her but i am pretty sure she did agree to work with that guy when she spoke to him before  break.Because the new guy super confident about this part(that he will get funding and thesis).</em></p>

<p><strong>So can anybody please enlighten me as to why my advisor would lie to me here? Why would she lie to me that she didnt offer him thesis when she pretty well did , i mean i am just an student,right. Is she embarrassed by her mistake and that's why not admitting it?</strong></p>

15316,"<p>I studied Social Sciences (Development Economics concentration) at one of Europe's top ranked universities and achieved excellent grades, but had to interrupt my studies just before taking two final exams, entirely due to personal reasons - thus not completing my undergraduate degree.</p>

<p>While I was at uni, I obtained grants to run a new research project in my field with  sponsorship by some well-known professors. The progress of my work was published in an international journal and also a few industry magazines. I was also heavily involved in other projects around the university.
I mention these little details just to make it clear that I was not at uni just for the sake of getting a qualification, but because had a genuine intention of contributing to my field, to research and maybe become a professor.</p>

<p>While I was addressing my personal issues, I started working, first freelancing but later at a mid-sized company and have worked my way up to middle management. My job is somewhat related to what I studied and also very analytical, although it's obviously business-focused.</p>

<p>I am wondering what options I have...
- if I wanted to return to a research based position; 
- especially, if returning to university might turn out to be too hard/long (might have to re-do the entire undergraduate studies while working)
- and whether it might be easier (but also possible) to try applying straight into think-tanks and development focused positions.</p>

<p>One of my concerns is that despite my good CV in business, I don't have the same quantitative-analytical and research skills of someone who studied at postgraduate level. It's one of the subjects I enjoyed most and even enjoy at work, but how can I prove myself to future employers?</p>

<p>I think my question boils down to: how much do my achievements matter, and what else do I need to do to make up for no degree?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATES / Answers to questions in comments:</strong>
I dropped out of my own, for very personal reasons. In fact, I almost disappeared without notice and had to leave to another country. I am also a bit reluctant to discuss with my university about what those personal reasons were, but trust me they were very serious.
So I would have mixed feelings about returning to the same university.
I am sure I have disappointed many people there, and they would not understand why I left...</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2 / Answers to rocinante's update :)</strong>
There must have been a misunderstanding. I didn't mention nor imply anywhere that I considered faking my credentials to advance my career. I started at entry level with my current employer and progressed from within, i.e. there were no academic requirements when I started, but I proved them that I had the skills required for my current level.
To be more specific, I am asking about whether there might be chances for alternative training to get into a more advanced research path. Adult learning, online courses, non-degree professional certificates.
For example, I have heard of several people getting into MBA programs after 5-7 years of work experience, but no degree.
Are there analogue routes into research?
I hope this clarifies.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3 / Answers to Ben Webster and rocinante</strong>
Thanks both of you. It's true I should consider my old university; I am just very afraid that it might not work and considering what alternatives I may have should my attempts fail. I am also not belittling the value of degrees, BUT simply wondering how else I could prove myself, improve my knowledge, use a professional body route rather than academic etc. if the old university option won't succeed.
I know many doors will close, but I am determined and convinced that my potential, passion and skills far outweigh what's on paper.</p>

<p>I see <em>most</em> of the people who do a PhD leave academia afterwards and start looking for jobs (is it also the same in the US?). Very few people continue with a postdoc and remain in academia after getting the PhD.</p>

<p><em>My question is then, what is the pint of doing a PhD (especially if one gets a job in industry afterwards)? <strong>What are the benefits of spending 3-5 years obtaining a PhD?</strong> What kind of goals should a person enrolling in a PhD program have?</em></p>

<p>From the point of view of <em>industry</em>, I realize that after a PhD they might start with a high position in the company. But, on the other hand, in those 5 years they could have started a small tech company and make it somehow medium or even a bit successful. Instead of doing a PhD, after 5 years of investing in their own company, they could be paid for working for themselves and not for others, having their own companies. </p>

<p>From the point of view of <em>obtaining knowledge,</em> if someone is curious about <em>knowing</em>, they could learn new things by themselves. After graduation, finding a job or starting a company, knowledge could be obtained by buying books and reading during one's free time, or following extra courses. I don't think you don't need a university for this.</p>

<p>Am I right in my analysis? Is it true most people go to the industry after the PhD (I'm especially curious about people in the US from top universities)?</p>

<p>If my analysis is at least partially right, and since there is other viable ways to become successful in industry <em>and</em> to obtain knowledge, what are the benefits of doing a PhD? Is it only a good idea for people with strong plans to continue in academia, or are there other goals one can achieve (better) by obtaining a PhD?

<p>I wrote a paper (beyond the coursework) that presents a solution to one of the unsolved problems facing our conceptions of personal identity. I regard it as worth publishing, but I get that, as an undergrad, I may not have much of a sense of what qualifies a paper as ""worth publishing."" So I took a few precautions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I read the recently published arguments, and the arguments that preceded them. </p></li>
<li><p>I critically thought about whether the argument could contribute to the field</p></li>
<li><p>I presented the argument to some people accomplished in fields that depend on logical thinking {a physicist, a lawyer,a mathematician}. The mathematician told me of a few useful concepts in math that I should incorporate into the argument, I studied them, incorporated them, and re-presented the paper to him, and he felt it was clear and logically sound. </p></li>
<li><p>I asked some academically successful people {two medical doctors and a Harvard mathematics graduate} for their opinion on it. They agreed with me; however, none of them had much experience publishing research. </p></li>
<li>I presented it to the prof.</li>
</ol>

<p>The prof's responses seemed defensive. However, I get that I may have had a defensive bent  that disposed me to regarding her criticism as her 'just responding defensively'. So I recalled the conversation to people who I believed would tell me that I had mischaracterized her responses, if they suspected that I had done so - and none of them did.</p>

<p>I also get that,</p>

<ol>
<li>most professors -like anyone- want to make the most of their time, and that</li>
<li>most people usually see what they expect to see, and that</li>
<li>most professors probably would not expect an undergraduate paper to contain much worthwhile.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, I suspect that most wouldn't want to read it, and that if a prof agreed to read it, an extra measure of prejudice would affect her assessment of it. </p>

<p>I say all of that to say that I have reason to believe I should try and publish the paper, but I didn't succeed when I tried the most obvious path to doing so (presenting it to the prof), and I don't suspect that I'd have much success asking other profs to read it.  </p>

<p>I am currently in the process of formally naming the forms of monetary support that my university's research council is providing to its employees.  My question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there any formal document that describes the difference between a grant and an award?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm also interested in how the terms <em>grant</em> and <em>award</em> differ from other terms such as <em>incentive</em>, <em>fellowship</em>, <em>scholarship</em>, <em>professorial chair</em>, and so on.</p>

<p>For example, I know that one who is applying for a grant submits a proposal to be able to get funding for an activity that has not yet been done.  I also know that some awards require nominations (and some disallow self-nomination) and are given for work that has already been done.  I know that grants usually require liquidation of the monetary support given; I am not sure if the same is true for awards.  Grants sometimes have clauses where the recipient is to return the monetary support if he or she fails to submit the expected outputs; I am not sure if the same is true for awards.</p>

15491,"<p>It's a common meme that people often embark on and develop business projects while in graduate school. However, it's unclear how frequently this actually happens in ""real life"".</p>

<p>More importantly, how responsible/ethical a choice is it, in say, a funded PhD program? I know that typically there is a guideline for hours worked for such a position, but that's almost a joke in comparison to implicit requirements like standards of research quality and publication rate.</p>

<p>Assume that you are a student earnestly engaged in both the PhD topic and an unrelated side project, and you want both the PhD and the business to succeed (i.e., graduate, publish, launch side project as successful startup). To me it seems like the worst-case scenario in that situation would be running into a tough problem in research, while still putting in occasional hours on the side project, as that would look terrible.</p>

<p>My question is, since they rejected the first draft of the paper, can I ethically call the second draft, the one with major revisions and extra science, the pre-peer review paper. It was the raw draft submitted prior to the second set of reviews after which they accepted the paper. Or because that paper did benefit from the first set of peer reviews, I should post the original first draft? My guess is that I am allowed to post the second draft; what do you think?</p>

He typically leaves any mathematical, or CS, aspect of the projects to me to figure out, and provides guidance when I have questions regarding the biology or biochemistry, as those are his fields of expertise. </p>

<p>From what I hear, he's similarly loose in supervision even with the other grad students who are less cross-disciplinary and more aligned with his expertise. While I see the point in the supervisor providing the freedom to the grad student to develop as he/she likes, in my experience it can be troubling at times, allow me to explain: </p>

<p>I often have extensive periods where I don't have concrete goals to work with, but only vague ideas. Similarly, since I don't get a lot of technical guidance there are often weeks-long periods where I don't ""produce"" anything but instead trying to dig information out on publications, CS blogs or StackOverflow, in order to solve a problem I encounter. </p>

<p>It's at times like these my daily concerns (stuff usually unrelated to work) take precedence over what I am actually trying to figure out. I find myself browsing for gadgets, or looking over my savings or reading the news etc. I have no illusions that this amounts to procrastination no matter how you look at it. Since I don't really need to report anything to my supervisor on a regular basis, these periods can be extensive which often leads to frustration. And having realised this, I would like to be more productive even when I am stuck at my project, hopefully minimise the time it takes until I come up with a solution to whatever it is that's hindering progress.</p>

<p>So my question boils down to: how can I make sure I work efficiently, i.e. I don't get distracted or succumb to procrastination, when I am stuck and only get very loose supervision?</p>

I'm the average student who likes math a lot, so I took more than 10 graduate courses and higher division undergraduate courses in mathematics.  For two courses, I received two C grades in those graduate courses by the same professor (hard exams and finals).  I attempted to get better grade in one of those courses, but received the F (because of super hard final and midterm, and because of the same professor).  For the undergraduate courses, I got mostly A's and one B+.</p>

15555,"<p><strong>My Questions:</strong> How can I express interest to receive invitation to serve as a reviewer in a top ranked conference? Currently I am registered with the conference review system (i.e., EDAS) and I receive review invitations from ordinary conferences, but I consider review in high quality conferences. Is there any feasible way to express interest and show that I have technical expertise to judge papers in a particular area. I know that having certain academic qualification (like master and more commonly PhD) and research experience is must to become nominated in top conferences. </p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> Researchers more or less receive invitations to serve as reviewer of a journal or conference. I guess the process in journals to identify reviewers is one of three main channels </p>

<ol>
<li>Author suggests potential reviewer</li>
<li>Reviewer's profile is in the review system from previous submission</li>
<li>Reviewers can express interest to become reviewer in journals (Some journals have link to register).</li>
</ol>

<p>and there should be other ways to feed information into the journal review system (that I might have missed).</p>

<p>However, in conferences, it is slightly different because </p>

<ol>
<li>normally there is no registration link to express interest (I have not seen), </li>
<li>usually there is no option that authors nominate reviewers while submitting a paper to conference (at least I have not experienced the same). </li>
</ol>

<p>the only way left compared to journal is that reviewer registers with the conference review system for paper submission. So in future, when organizing committee is selecting TPCs and reviewers, they can invite already-registered members to play as reviewers.</p>

<p>What about references, future relationships, etc? Is it taken negatively or as an insult, or cutting ties, to bow out with the lower degree?</p>

15632,"<p>Seems it's the second time that I came to ask a question here. But this time the situation is quite different for me. </p>

<p>I've completed my B.S. 2.5 years ago, and entered a PhD program in a top notch school. My advisor is a domain expect in my field and he treats all of us very nicely and friendly, and he does know a hell lot of both academia and industry. I just received my master degree and interned at a uprising company in Silicon Vally. </p>

<p>However for academic work, I'm not doing that well. The past 2.5 years I only published in a workshop. In the meanwhile many of my friends have published top conference papers. I feel really stupid that I can't do so. Since my mathematic background is not well to understand some papers, I tried to digest the math while I'm on free time. And now I could understand most of the papers that I read. </p>

<p>The problem is that, I can't think of new ideas. Every ideas I try fails, constantly. I'm don't know why my mates could do so well in publishing. Because of this, I seriously feel a lot of pressure. Everyday when I wake up, I can feel the heart beats like dumb. However during the internship in the previous summer, everything is so smooth and I enjoyed the life there. </p>

<p>In theory, my advisor could let me graduate even if I don't publish. But I really do not want to let him down and waste his funding. The question is, shall I quit my PhD now and receive the offer if the pressure continues? Any suggestions?</p>

15685,"<p>I'm a CS master student in a German university. Here we have to do a master project in one semester and the master thesis in another semester, so in total 12 months. In the project you start in defining and exploring the problem space and so on and building a preliminary software framework that will help you more in the thesis. In the thesis you build on that to expand your work and finally summarize everything.</p>

<p>My problem started with the problem definition. My supervisor didn't have an idea of what to work on, so he just came up with a fancy idea and told me to work on without knowing if it's logical or it can be applied or not. So I started working on that problem and trying to reformulate the problem into a logical project and thesis. I spent 8 months on that and finally I built the software framework and so on. However after finishing the work, I found that continuing with the problem in the same formulation as-is won't be logical and would make everything as rubbish work. So I found a better formulation to the problem that makes it much much better and would lead to publish a paper in a conference or a workshop. However my new formulation cancels out 75% of my previous work. This way I won't have much of stuff to write in my master thesis.</p>

<li>Projects a about completely new idea.</li>
<li>Projects about improving an existing technical concept.</li>
</ol>

<p>By the first one I mean completely new stuff (something I'm doing now as my thesis). Such projects require intensive thinking to formulate them and put them into academic contexts and logics. While a lot of the time will be used to try and test new things as well as justyfing and putting the results into proper academic context and logic, very few time could be spent learning <em>advanced stuff</em> regarding your field.</p>

<p>In the other kinds of projects one would need to improve the running time of an algorithm or its performance. Such projects would require the student to go into very deep stuff regarding his field and become really advanced.</p>

<p><strong>&lt; rant></strong>
My current advisor is insane and unfair. She didn't let me take part in a conference paper that she and another student worked on. That was a very good chance for me to improve my chances of getting to graduate school, but now it's lost. She slightly modified the Caesar cipher and the other student just wrote a program that demonstrates her ""algorithm"", and it took him several days, while I could've done that in 4-8 hours.</p>

<p>Second time around, I decided(took her advice) to take the research category in a course where we have to make a project my the end of the semester. She didn't guide me or provide me with any references or resources that could help me. She just tells me ""write it and I'll read it"" or ""look it up and understand it"". I spent most the semester trying to get my head around the research topic and implement the algorithms, until I finally had to change to the development category because I was going to fail the course otherwise. Now she tells me that ""she lost trust in me"" and that she won't waste her time with me again.

<p>So obviously my relationship with her is not very good, but what can I do now? Is doing research(or ""research"" in this case) at the undergraduate level mandatory for applying to graduate programs?

Whatever be the outcome of the proposal(s), I am starting my collaboration with them soon. </p>

<p>My dilemma starts here. The fellowships each one suggested are very competitive. Those faculties themselves informed me that getting those fellowships became more difficult in the present financial situation. Now is it ethical to do apply for multiple funding agencies in this way? Fortunately, each of them suggested applying for different fellowships. I am slightly afraid of the morality of the whole issue (like: what if all of the projects get funding). Please help. </p>

15824,"<p>This has been a subject that has occupied my thoughts for the past years but haven't really managed to formulate it completely for myself. I have this feeling (and I can't say it's more than a feeling at this point) that native speakers of English have an easier time with getting their article published.</p>

<p>I should make it clear, right away, that I don't mean just because you are a native speaker you can get whatever published, but given a particular project, if the main author is a native speaker the article is more likely to get accepted, or at least draw more positive reviews. I motivate the potential existence of such a bias on the fact that it's likely that a native speaker does a better job in writing than someone who has English as a foreign language. </p>

<p>Since I do not have any data to back this theory up, I would like to ask if you have come across any numbers/facts regarding any such bias in the publication/acceptance rates in general, as well as high-IF journals specifically. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I should perhaps rephrase and add a bit more details to the question here. I do not refer to small grammatical mistakes, misspellings or anything of that nature. What I am referring to here, is the wider vocabulary a native-speaker has in his/her disposal, the phrases and expressions that they use that might not be readily and easily available to non-native speaker. I could perhaps summarise it the differences as the metaphorical chocolate chips that a native speaker can and most likely will bake into the cookie that is the manuscript.</p>

<p>I am clear on the point that the clearness criteria is still the most important and that's why I did not talk about the rejections (it's natural that non-native speakers get their papers rejected based on language more often compared to native speakers). As a non-native speaker myself, it is beyond any doubt that I need to write my manuscripts with a clearly understandable language in order for them to get published, but again that's not really what I am asking here. I am more interested in whether or not articles written by native speakers come across as ""better quality"" based on the fact that they are more likely to utilise their edge with the language.</p>

My motivations are personal interest, and also to keep my options open in case I decide to apply for an academic or research post in 2016.</p>

<p>I am not sure where I should start looking for a project.  Should I read academic papers until I get ideas?  Should I just try and brainstorm my own ideas?  Should I go back to my current university supervisor, or my previous PhD supervisor?</p>

<p><em>My Background</em></p>

<p>I am nearly 41 and married with two children (aged 10 and 13).  I gained my bachelor's in computing in 2006. In 2012 I submitted a thesis in artificial intelligence (case-based reasoning) and the PhD was awarded in 2013.  My family are not keen on moving and we live in an area with very few high-tech or academic employment opportunities. </p>

<p>I can't see a way to extend my PhD research.  I have never worked as a post-doc; before the PhD I was a database administrator and immediately afterwards I was a software developer. </p>

<p>Fortunately, late in 2013 I found a position on a UK government scheme known as Knowledge Transfer Partnerships.  I am employed by a Scottish university to work within an English manufacturing company, to use AI techniques to solve a particular engineering problem.  I am based at the manufacturing company and I see my university supervisor very rarely.  I am not allowed to publish anything from this employment. The contract ends in August 2016.</p>

<p>The KTP project will probably use standard AI methods; I won't be inventing any new techniques.  If the manufacturing company consented (and they will not!) it would be possible to publish, but it would only be as an interesting application of AI, not a new way of doing AI.</p>

<p>I have a substantial training budget (GBP £2000 a year) which—with the approval of my employer—I can spend going to conferences, buying books etc.</p>

<p>I have discussed the idea of doing research with my university supervisor, either performing experiments myself, or a literature review paper.  She made some nice noises but she was not overly enthusiastic.  I think she is worried that it will divert me from the KTP project (for which her university gets paid a lot of consultancy money) and possibly upset the construction company who I am based with.</p>

<p>My interests and skills lie in artificial intelligence (neural networks, case-based reasoning), computer-aided design and software engineering.</p>

<p>I still have my PhD supervisor on my LinkedIn page and I could approach her.  However, I worry that she will think it is strange if I ask to collaborate with her, given that I am currently employed by a different university.</p>

<p>I can commute to my current workplace (it's about an hour away) and there are 2 good universities (and another two not-so-good ones) about 60-90 minutes' commute from our family home, so location is the biggest restriction for me, I can't force my wife and children to move.</p>

15947,"<p>Below is an example using my scenario, but I think the question is very general.</p>

<p>I had a parent diagnosed with a life threatening illness, and that brought up terrible suppressed emotions that were bottled up inside from when my other parent died awhile back ago. My head was not in the right place, and outside of getting through my teaching duties, my brain just couldn't function the right way for research. As a result, I did not work as much as I should have, and when I did I was pretty all over the place. I concealed my emotional pain pretty well, and put up a good face while in the office/lab, so no one suspected personal problems, but my work definitely suffered. My parent's illness looks to be getting better now and after some counseling I feel like my life is back on track. </p>

<p>However, I feel like it is possible that my advisor's opinion of me has greatly declined due to my lack of productivity the past 1.5 years (based on subtle cues, he is really nice so he would never say so outright). I think this could affect my future letters of recommendation and anything else that might go along with an advisor having a poor opinion of his PhD student. Would telling your advisor about personal problems, after they are over, with the intent of the advisor understanding a lack of productivity be appropriate? Would doing so just sound like excuses and make things worse? Or perhaps it would make you sound emotionally weak? Would perhaps it be best to bring it up once I got some really good results, somewhat casually as a ""life is on the right track again kind of comment."" I really have no idea how to deal with this. </p>

<p>I think the fact that the problems are no longer going on might make it inappropriate to mention it to the advisor. I assume it would have probably been better if I had mentioned it back when I was going through the problems, but is it a good idea to mention it now, or just cut my losses, work hard and hope he forgets about those unproductive years. </p>

<p>So my question is. When is it appropriate to bring up personal problems with an advisor? In this case and in general?</p>

15951,"<p>I have read in multiple places that it is a good practice as an academic to keep a <em>research journal</em>.
For example, Marie desJardins' paper <a href=""http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~mariedj/papers/advice-summary.html""><em>How to Succeed in Graduate School: A Guide for Students and Advisors</em></a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keeping a journal of your research activities and ideas is very useful.
  Write down speculations, interesting problems, possible solutions, random ideas, references to look up, notes on papers you've read, outlines of papers to write, and interesting quotes.
  Read back through it periodically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My first attempt was to write my ideas in a log book.
I soon gave that up because the book would not always be with me when I wanted to write something in it, and because I knew eventually I would lose it and not be able to retrieve information from it.</p>

<p>My current approach is to write a huge LaTeX file which I store in the cloud.
In it, I chronicle my daily thoughts about my research project, to take notes of what is discussed in meetings with my adviser.
However, I simply feel overwhelmed by the volume of writing and the amount of repetition that I find in my research journal.
I also have other files which serve similar purposes.
For example, I have a file called <code>results.pdf</code> where I write out all my theorems and propositions and their proofs.</p>

16101,"<p>I am a US-based researcher and was offered a position as a postdoctoral researcher at a Swedish institute. The offer came in December, and I have negotiated some terms, which the school accepted. All of this happened via email and very quick. As the school accepted the various terms exactly as I wanted, I decided to accept the offer and wrote back saying that I will be joining the team. </p>

<p>Now, this is where the issue comes in. I know I need to file some paper work to proceed, which exact steps I am not yet sure about. I have sent two emails inquiring about the issue to the professor in charge, but I have not gotten any response back.</p>

<p>I find it strange that my emails are being ignored and this is making me worried. Some acquaintances over in Stockholm has suggested that because many people take time off during the holidays, things can slow down considerably in December-January (I haven't been there and I have no idea how things work there), but it is almost end of January and I do need to get the paper work done soon to be able to relocate on time. What should I do? </p>

Guess what, my advisor ran out of funding, and he blamed us (the graduate students) for no publication. Now we all have to serve as TAs. I somehow manage to pump out my own project but my advisor didn't quite like it unless it's his idea. He told me he had no funding for my proposal and continue to gamble on his own project. (Come to think of it, no funding was a lie.) Recently, I am publishing my paper and the way he edited my manuscript is always cursory, mindless and pushy.

<p>Note that in my university, there is not such a strict discipline, in the sense that late submissions are often tolerated; if students forget to send their files, I'd like to gently remind them to do so; etc.</p>

<p>So far, I use e-mail for managing student submissions, but there are several limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Students forget to send the e-mail, or send it to an incorrect address, or simply quit the course, but since I do not know in which case they are, I have to manually e-mail students from which no submission has been received;</li>
<li>Students have no guarantee I actually received the email, so I have to ACK them;</li>
<li>Students sometimes send an e-mail but forget the attachment, so I have to check each of them and notify the student;</li>
<li>Students sometimes send multiple versions, and if there is a deadline between them, it might change the grading criteria;</li>

16303,"<p>Yesterday, during some idle time in the office, a colleague of mine has discovered that I am currently ranked at position 20 worldwide by <a href=""http://academic.research.microsoft.com"">Microsoft Academic Search</a> for my subfield regarding the last 5 year impact. While certainly flattering, this ranking is also quite clearly bogus, as many much more eminent academics are ranked far behind me in this list.</p>

<p>The Occam's razor explanation that there simply is another researcher of my name in my field can be discarded, as Microsoft Academic profile does indeed list my, and only my, publications (as well as a profile pic that they seem to have grabbed from an old university web page).</p>

<p>So my question is the following: <strong>how does Microsoft Academic Search actually generate rankings</strong> (of individual academics, but there are also rankings of journals)? It seems clear that not all citations and publications are considered equal (otherwise I would not end up so far to the front with a comparatively meager set of papers and citations), but how do they decide what is ""worth"" how much?</p>

<p>I am mostly looking for answers that refer to papers or web links coming from MS insiders  on their ranking algorithms. Barring that, some well thought-through speculation from outsiders is also ok :)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I just discovered that Microsoft Academic Search seems to employ the notion of a <em>field rating</em> for conferences and journals, and the rating for some of the venues that we prefer seems to be unreasonably high. However, that still does not fully explain my curious case (and it still leaves open the question of how these field ratings are generated in the first place).</p>

16330,"<p>The situation is thus: my institution allows professors to buy out of teaching a class.  This semester, my advisor has done so and as a result they needed someone to fill in.  After discussion with my advisor, I applied for the position to gain teaching experience (having had none previously).</p>

<p>Thus far, teaching the class has gone smoothly but our department has a huge waitlist problem.  When I originally applied for the position, the class had 40 spots.  Later, without my input, it was increased to 60, and there were still over 50 people on the waitlist.</p>

<p>Prior to the class starting, my advisor attempted to get the department chair to increase the class size to 90 so that more waitlisted people could get in.  However, the chair responded by saying that the department felt that it was important for graduate students, particularly in their first attempt at teaching, to have a good experience, so they didn't want to increase the class size so drastically without my approval.  I responded telling them that I didn't feel comfortable taking on so many students when I hadn't taught before and the issue was dropped.</p>

<p>Now, in the second week of classes, my advisor is again pressuring me to admit any waitlisted students that would like to take the course, increasing the class size to 70+.  I've told him several times that I am not comfortable with this and thought the issue was closed.  However, one of the waitlisted students has gone directly to my advisor and now he's specifically telling me to admit this student.</p>

<p>As it stands, I currently have 62 students in a 60 person class and I understand that taking on one extra student is technically not a big deal.  However, I feel uncomfortable for several reasons: </p>

<ol>
<li>It feels like I'm rewarding bad behavior (e.g., the student going to my advisor and forcing entrance into the class)</li>
<li>If I admit this student for going to my advisor, I am concerned that every other student on the waitlist will go to my advisor and I'll get similar e-mails about all of them and suddenly my class size will be 70+ students</li>

<ul>
<li>""Careful what you wish for"" and</li>
<li>""With great power comes great responsibility""</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout my high school and undergraduate education I kept (naively, I now reckon) chasing the dream of ultimate <a href=""http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1436"" rel=""nofollow"">academic freedom</a>, where I would be able to study freely and learn at will, unencumbered by artificial constraints like scheduled classes, deadlines, curricula, etc. So I went after it, first getting a master's and now a pursuing PhD, but now that the classes and assignments are finally over, I find myself <em>unable to handle the freedom I wished for</em>. It wasn't even a sudden change: at each step, as the external support/control structures grew thinner, I had to rely more and more in self-discipline, but I failed to recognize my ineptitude on time.</p>

<p>Now, I'll be the first to admit that this issue isn't new or unique (indeed, the <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/q/2219/1348"">two</a> <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/q/5786/1348"">most</a> voted questions on this site deal with this kind of problem), but here's why I'm <em>still</em> asking this question: <strong>what I'm aiming for isn't tools or best practices</strong>; 
todo lists, well-defined schedules, website blockers, I've tried pretty much all of those, and I've also read a lot about procrastination, motivation, flow, etc. I've been battling these issues for several years now, and I've been through this cycle many times, attempting new tools and techniques that work for a while, only to find myself back in a self-defeating loop of procrastination. I recently decided to seek psychological counseling precisely because I recognized I wasn't able to deal with this alone.</p>

<p>Essentially, I recognize my dependence on a structured environment to be productive, but also (due to attempting and failing many times) my inability to create and maintain such external structures. I'm therefore looking for strategies to improve my ability to motivate myself to actually follow the rules I try to impose on myself. So rather than creating friction in trying to control my behavior, <strong>I'm seeking strategies that make it the <a href=""http://matt.might.net/articles/productivity-tips-hints-hacks-tricks-for-grad-students-academics/"" rel=""nofollow"">path of least resistance</a> to be productive and organized.</strong> My hopes, since all else has failed so far, is to use the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_it_till_you_make_it"" rel=""nofollow"">fake it till you make it</a> approach to eventually become an actual organized and self-disciplined person.</p>

<p>As an example, I have suppressed all sorts of notifications (a common advice), and don't keep my email or any such pages open in the background, to minimize the chance of interruptions. I also changed the chair in my desk to one that makes it less easy to slouch, based on the principle that <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=h7NewH-XWgUC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=%22where+our+bodies+go,+our+minds+will+follow%22"" rel=""nofollow"">body posture affects mental state</a>. Setting defaults such as these essentially ""outsources"" decisions I would otherwise have to make consciously, thus depleting my willpower. I also use <a href=""http://beeminder.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Beeminder</a> to ""outsource motivation"", but it doesn't fit perfectly to every case. I'm interested in hearing how others dealt with the need to gradually develop the ability to self-regulate, particularly in the context of academia.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I think my question was a little more pessimistic than it should (and definitely too verbose, sorry!). To be clear, my previous attempts <em>did</em> lead to some long-term improvement, but in a rather slow, two-steps-forward-one-step-backward kind of way. <strong>I'm not claiming those techniques don't work</strong>, but I believe it would be useful for many people to have a compiled list of environmental changes that ""outsource"" the need to make small decisions that otherwise have to be made each time, since most productivity advice focuses on the latter.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I suppose there is a legal perspective to this, but I know that academia has its own norms and conventions regarding attribution and respecting the wishes of authors. So I'd be particularly interested in answers framed in that context. I.e., My broader aim is to be the first to publish my own research, generally get attribution, but also allow others to build on that work. So I'd be interested also in what is considered good practice when you are in the situation of wanting to share data and code while an article is being peer reviewed, but not wanting to lose your right of first publication.</p>

16360,"<p>As we all know, you typically abbreviate something the first time that particular term shows up in a paper.  However, I've been told in the past that certain things in a paper should be written in such a way that 'it stands on its own'.  One such thing would include the abstract of the paper.  So, perhaps a <code>&lt;STRING&gt;</code> appears in the abstract that I want to abbreviate.  Now one of two things can happen.  </p>

<p>1.) If <code>&lt;STRING&gt;</code> appears more than once in the abstract, I could abbreviate the first instance and then just use the abbreviation from that point on.</p>

<p>2.) If <code>&lt;STRING&gt;</code> appears only ONCE in the abstract, then I shouldn't abbreviate it because then I would have defined an abbreviation that I would not have used again (given the concept of 'the abstract should be able to stand on its own).</p>

<p>The problem with (2) is that people will immediately think that the 'first instance' of <code>&lt;STRING&gt;</code> should be abbreviated and don't immediately consider the 'stand-alone' idea so I'm either having to revise or try to put up a convincing argument for what I did. </p>

<p>Also, I've been told by some that tables and figures should be able to 'stand on their own'.  So, if the abbreviation for <code>&lt;STRING&gt;</code> appears in the table somewhere (or the caption), then I should explicitly spell out <code>&lt;STRING&gt;</code> and then define an abbreviation for it right then and there, even if I have already done so earlier on in the text of the paper.</p>

<p>So, my question is, what is the proper way of handling these abbreviations and is the idea of 'this piece must be able to stand on its own' valid (and if its valid, what exactly does this idea apply to)?</p>

coupled-cluster method that includes all single and double substitutions as well as a perturbative treatment of the connected triple excitations"".  The list can go on and on.  If this wasn't abbreviated in an abstract, having to 'spell it out' even a few times would make for an incredibly long abstract, figure caption, table, etc.</p>

I am currently a doctoral candidate in civil engineering at University of Texas at Austin (ranked 6th in my discipline) and working as a student statistical consultant at the university consulting center. I am working on spatio-temporal modeling of count data using Bayesian hierarchical models, with computationally efficient techniques for my dissertation. (I will have publications on this very soon; two of them are in review). I do have 2 publications in my area but their topic is the application of statistical models. I am also going to get a Masters in statistics next semester along with my PhD in civil engineering. I have done many courses related to Bayesian statistics including graduate level mathematical statistics, theoretical MCMC, stochastic volatility and time series models, statistical consulting, advanced econometrics (non-Bayesian), discrete choice modeling and one course on data mining (graduate level). In my field, I see massive datasets but very minimal statistical expertise, particularly on the big data side. This has motivated me to pursue something beyond my Phd and beyond my discipline. </p>

My numerical scores were mediocre, and representative student comments included: ""Answers were obscure""; ""can sometimes be cryptic when answering questions""; ""didn't really answer questions"".</p>

<p>These comments do <em>not</em> appear to be sour grapes, as the same students didn't complain heavily about the workload or grading of the exams.

No responses.</p>

<p>I want to continue to a PhD, possibly at the same place I did my MSc, with a goal of staying in academia.</p>

<p>One advantage of Perimeter is that the program is completely free, while the tuition at Imperial is ridiculously high. What other advantages/disadvantages are there to the two institutions?</p>

<p>Additionally, how impressive, in the eyes of a PhD admissions committee, is a degree from the Perimeter Scholars International program compared to similar MSc degrees from prestigious universities (such as Imperial College)?</p>

<p>Their website says that ""all course grades are either Credit or No Credit"", and ""the final grade on the PSI Certificate will be Pass or Fail"". I take it to mean that there are no exams.</p>

<p>This is great if I will be able to continue to a PhD at Perimeter Institute. However, what if I can't continue at Perimeter, or I want to continue somewhere else? I know that high grades in the MSc degree make it easier to get to PhD programs at prestigious universities (I'm thinking mainly about the UK and Canada, not the US). If I don't have any grades, then in particular I don't have high grades; ""pass"" can be translated as anything between 50% and 100%.</p>

<p>Also, the actual MSc degree is from the University of Waterloo, which is of course a fine institution but not really prestigious or well-known, particularly in theoretical physics (currently ranked no. 180 in the world). Again, does the PSI Certificate make this degree equivalent to a degree from a prestigious university in the eyes of the PhD admissions committee?</p>

16526,"<p>People:</p>

<p>I found one similar question here that was not focused on mathematics.  I think this question fits better here than in Mathematics Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>I work in the mathematics department of a university that has a new, small, mathematics bachelor's degree program, and no graduate mathematics programs.  Some of our students are looking for advice on how to successfully apply for graduate school.  I don't know what to tell them.  Everyone in my department (myself included) applied to graduate school so long ago that I think our advice may not be relevant.  I don't think anyone else who works for my university knows more than my department colleagues do.</p>

<p>What are good things for students at a small school to do to get into graduate school in mathematics?  In particular, what are some things that might not be obvious to mathematics professors who've been out of graduate school for a few decades?</p>

<p>EDIT: this question was put on hold for being ""too broad"".  I will attempt to sharpen it.  Almost all of my colleagues applied for grad school before the Web, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and many other things existed.  A lot of advice I would give students is too obvious to mention.  So here is my modified question:</p>

<p>What advice would you give students applying for graduate school in mathematics in 2014 that you would not have given them a decade or two ago?  In other words, how would the advice differ?  I am thinking both about what students have to do as undergrads and about the application process itself (which I assume is done online nowadays).</p>

<p>Is it acceptable to write most of the reference letter and have the prof make minor edits? Do academic institutions frown upon this practice? Would it be considered an academic offense if a student wrote a reference letter for themselves and had a prof sign it?</p>

16533,"<p>Throughout my life, I have always had some issues with what I, my peers and my teachers referred to colloquially as ""paying attention"". By this I mean a very specific ability to not make mistakes. Some very good examples are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A mathematically competent adult getting a calculus question wrong because of a simple arithmetic mistake, such as 5+3=15.</li>
<li>A well-prepared student getting a multiple choice question wrong because it was asking ""which of the above are not true"", but he mistakenly selected the ones that <em>are</em> true.</li>
<li>A skilled roboticist damaging an expensive circuit because he accidentally wired the components incorrectly.</li>
<li>Mixing up two terms which refer to different things, despite understanding very well the concept that either term refers to.</li>
<li>Typos and simple grammar errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that I do not mean attention in the sense of being able to concentrate on and pay attention to a topic. I am specifically talking about the ability to not make mistakes (where mistakes are simple errors, which you know are wrong but do not notice at the time - <strong>not</strong> errors you committed because you lacked understanding of a key concept or because you didn't know any better).</p>

<p>While this ""attention"" obviously influences ability to do well on tests, it also affects my day-to-day work in 2 key ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>When performing an involved experiment, things such as mixing up samples, accidentally skipping a step of the procedure, forgetting to clearly label the samples and so on may ruin the whole experiment - either because the experiment no longer works when that simple mistake is made, or because the mistake has made the results uninterpretable.</li>
<li>When working with a tool that does not provide much automated error checking, I can end up producing data or programs that are incorrect due to some mistakes I made. It may take me a very long time to detect these bugs - and until I do, all conclusions I draw from my results are unreliable (and I am not aware of this!). Even after I discover the bug, the work done up to that point is still wasted.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>So, my question: Is ""attention"" in this sense (ability to make few mistakes) a skill, or innate? Is there any way for me to improve this skill? Can it be trained, or is it an invariant quality of a person that they can only accept and accommodate?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Note that, for the ""making mistakes when doing something complicated"" problem, there exist the solutions of</p>

<ul>
<li>""break it down into simpler chunks which you are less likely to make mistakes with""</li>
<li>""restructure your complicated activity such that mistakes are rendered obvious"".</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not very interested in these sorts of solutions, because restructuring the task is not always possible, feasible and efficient. Some things simply cannot be made any less complicated than they are.</p>

<p>Also, while I welcome discussions of the physiology of this problem, it is very unlikely that my problem is ADD or a similar disorder. As the saying goes, to err is human - but some humans err more than others, and I am interested in understanding why (and more precisely, what strategies are available to make oneself err less).</p>

<p>I have a related but somewhat different question: Given no choice, is it acceptable to write a recommendation letter for self?</p>

<p>This question is based on real cases. In non-English speaking countries, many professors don't know how to write good recommendation letters in English. The professor may know how to write papers in English in his field. But, when writing recommendation letters, he has limited vocabulary to write about his students. In other words, his English is not proficient. To make the matter worse, some professors may only be able to  write simple English sentences. The professor may tell the student the contents of the letter in his native language and ask the student to translate it into English and then signs it.</p>

<p>The student may want somebody else to write the letter because he does not want the professor to do this unethical thing. But, the professor just happens to be his advisor(undergraduate or master). The student may want to suggest his professor to ask the professor's colleagues for help to write the letter. The professor may say no. Therefore, the student writes the recommendation letter for himself by translating the professor's draft in their native language into English.</p>

16548,"<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The best guideline I have found so far is the Chicago Manual of Style 16th ed, section 14.58 ""DIVIDING A BIBLIOGRAPHY INTO SECTIONS"" (I have boldfaced the part which best answers my question):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A bibliography may occasionally be divided into sections--but only if doing so would make the
  reader's job significantly easier. Where readers need to refer frequently from notes to bibliography, a
  continuous alphabetical list is far preferable, since in a subdivided bibliography the alphabetizing
  starts over with each section. Rarely should books be separated from articles, since a book and an
  article by the same author are best listed close together. <strong>It may be appropriate to subdivide a
  bibliography (1) when it includes manuscript sources, archival collections, or other materials that do
  not fit into a straight alphabetical list;</strong> (2) when readers need to see at a glance the distinction between
  different kinds of works--for example, in a study of one writer, between works by the writer and
  those about him or her; or (3) when the bibliography is intended primarily as a guide to further
  reading (as in this manual). When divisions are necessary, a headnote should appear at the beginning
  of the bibliography, and each section should be introduced by an explanatory subhead (see fig. 14.9).
  No source should be listed in more than one section. For alphabetizing, see 14.60--62.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm trying to find a style guide or similar on how to structure or organise a bibliography or reference section at the end of a book. Perhaps this applies most to a dissertation thesis where there are many different types of references. I am not looking for citation style guides on how to format specific types of references (I can find many such guides), but rather how to order them into groups by type, or even whether to do it in the first place.</p>

<p>For example, in my dissertation, I am currently considering a structure roughly like below (very simplified and inaccurate but only to get my point across). Now suppose I add more sections for journal articles, anthologies, etc... and this bibliography grows quite large, say over 30 pages or so. What is considered good practice here? See the two examples below. I find the first alternative a lot more tidy and easier to read, while the second is cluttered and just doesn't feel right.</p>

<p>I have found some recommendations which contradict each other. <a href=""https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/library/teaching/writingyourbibliography.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/library/teaching/writingyourbibliography.pdf</a> on page 3 says </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should not divide your bibliography into separate sections for different document
  types.
  References should contain all of the information required for a reader to find a source. Standards
  have been set for different document types to ensure that each reference contains the information
  necessary to aid retrieval of the source.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But there is no further explanation why there shouldn't be separate sections.</p>

<blockquote>

16575,"<p>In Australia we follow something known as the ERA ranking, when submitting papers to journals and conferences. My lab stresses publication in venues which are graded as only A or A(star), as per this system ( ERA-A increases possibilities of funding). In the area of biomedical engineering there is a specific conference named ""IASTED International Conference on Biomedical Engineering"" which I found is ranked as ERA-A alongside the biomedical conference IEEE EMBC (which is a premier venue in biomedical engineering). Apart from these not a lot of international biomedical conferences are ERA A-ranked. </p>

<p>The problem is I found a lot of negative reviews about IASTED conferences online and therefore am skeptical about sending my paper there. Yet, I also know that an ERA-A rank publication very early in my doctoral program can make a good impact on the committee, when my doctoral assessment review comes up later this year. Moreover, this will release some pressure/tension in terms of the doctoral review and I could go on to work on larger targets without worrying about the doctoral assessment ( since it would be considered good progress if I can show an ERA-A paper in the first year of my program). </p>

<p>However much I try, I have failed to understand how IASTED biomed gets a top australian rank, when IASTED conferences are being discouraged online. One possibility, is that IASTED Biomed is the only one which may be famous. The other is a lot australian academics might have been ranking IASTED biomed as ERA-A. But if so, why only Australia?

16582,"<p>Looking around online, there are some statistics that foretell doom for PhD students; some examples of this:</p>

<ul>
<li>the number of faculty to retire in the next 10 years is at the lowest in 30 years.</li>
<li>the number of PhDs awarded is around 100,000, while the number of professor positions open is around 16,000.</li>
<li>there has been approximately 40% budget cut for math between 2008-2011 (but there was a hiring freeze put on most state universities in 2009-2010, if I remember correctly, so this may not be entirely accurate).</li>

The creator of this argues that the number of grad students and postdocs is way too high, while the number of professors is on the decline.</p>

<p>I think that this is not true for math. Postdocs are considered to be a mandatory part in our career (and postdoc positions are quite competitive!), and while many people do a second postdoc, I rarely see people with more than two postdoc experiences. Also, there aren't so many adjunct positions; some postdoc positions are called adjuncts, but these usually expire in 1-3 years. So I would like to know the real statistics. In particular, I want to know these figures for last year (percentages with respect to the number of PhDs will also do):</p>

<ul>
<li>the number of PhDs awarded (all figures from here onwards applying just to the US)</li>
<li>the number of PhDs hired as postdocs at PhD-producing institutions</li>
<li>the number of PhDs hired as tenure-track professors at liberal arts colleges</li>
<li>the number of postdocs finishing</li>
<li>the number of postdocs hired as tenure-track professors at PhD-producing institutions</li>
<li>the number of postdocs hired as tenure-track professors at liberal arts colleges</li>
<li>the number of postdocs hired as postdocs at PhD-producing institutions</li>
</ul>

<p>To summarize, I would like to know how harsh the funneling process is in math; I know from experience that many grad students leave academia without obtaining a job as a postdoc. Is the same true of postdocs? How about the tenure-track level?</p>

<ul>
<li>I co-authored a series of papers with the professor and a senior graduate student. I was always the first author, and it'd be fair to say that I contributed 95% of the research work and 70% of the writing. Somehow the other student was invited to give several talks on our work at various department seminars. I hadn't known until recently when I accidentally discovered his slides in our shared repository. The problem is that, in his slides, he only put his name, and there was no mention of my name/no credit given to me.</li>
<li>Before joining the lab, I developed a research software, which was quite successful and widely used. When I joined the lab, I transferred the development to the lab, and a graduate student helped me to extend the software a bit. When programming, I always sign my code with my name: (C) 2010-2013 by My Name (Email). Just today, when I looked at the code (publicly shared on github), I discovered that the student had deleted my name from all the files and replaced with his name: (C) 2010-2013 by His Name (Email). He even hadn't joined the development until 2012. If people just look at the code, they would think he were the sole author.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule 7: Start writing the paper the day you have the idea of what questions to pursue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds like very good advice, not just because you would pace out the act of writing your paper over the entire duration of your research, but it would also help you stay focused and keep track of your progress.</p>

<p>However, in practice, how is this possible? To start writing a paper, I must first know what format and style it should be written in. To know that, I would consult the guidelines of the journal in which I want publish. But the choice of journal depends on the quality of the research and notability of findings. But if I start writing on the day that I start my research, how can I know what journal the research will be good enough for?</p>

<p>For instance, if I shoot high and assume I am going to have a Nature paper, what do I do if a year down the line, it turns out that I was unable to succeed in reaching my goals and Nature would not possibly accept my research? Now I have to rewrite from scratch for another journal, and the time I spent slowly building up my Nature manuscript is wasted. I might as well have focused on research only at first, and left the writing part for last.</p>

<p>What journal's submission guidelines do I pick to follow this <em>Rule 7</em>? The most prestigious journal? The humblest journal? Some generic set of guidelines for ""no journal""?</p>

<p>Rule 9 from the same text says:</p>

<blockquote>

16689,"<p>I'm a first-year undergraduate student in physics. Since starting my studies I've tried to get involved in research as much as possible. Recently, the guys I work with encouraged me to submit an abstract about my current project (which is the first serious one that I've taken on) for an upcoming conference. I did and I got accepted with a poster.</p>

<p>Now my question is: <strong>how should I approach this to benefit the most? Or maybe there isn't even a point in me going at all?</strong></p>

<p>I'm under the impression that most of the typical advantages of attending a conference such as networking, or keeping up-to-date with recent advances aren't really applicable to me as I simply lack the necessary knowledge. So far I've only taken a basic mechanics course and I have some working knowledge that I've acquired while working at the lab but nothing beyond that.</p>

<p>Additional information: the conference is obviously not a high-tier one. Judging by previous editions, about 150 attendees are expected, around 1/3-1/2 of that international (this is all in Europe by the way). Travel funding is provided by our department [active participation, in form of a poster, was part of the requirements to get that funding].</p>

16698,"<p>I am planning to double major in computer science and math for my undergraduate degree. Then focus my masters studies in Applied/Computational physics.</p>

<p>I want to incorporate physical things with computer science: what gets me excited is the advancements in cars and sustainable energy like Tesla and SolarCity. Is this a good sounding plan, does a masters in Applied Physics add any value to my computer science degree? Would the high workload be of any benefit in the future, and would this be the most effective use of my time, effort and money, as a way to make the transition into these industries?</p>

16706,"<p>I had a low Undergrad GPA, around or below the cutoff of most of the masters programs that interest me. I have since started pursuing a graduate certificate (Mining Massive Datasets from Stanford) and am doing much better (A's) than I did as an Undergrad.</p>

<p>What should I expect in terms of how universities look at the non-degree courses I have taken towards the certificate? I realise I could draw attention to the grades in my personal statement, but is there any precedent for including post-degree courses in the GPA calculation for cutoff purposes? How might they be weighted? What can I do to emphasise them?</p>

16712,"<p>I am currently applying for a mid-range private school that teaches the career I want primarily (software engineering) and a prestigious public school for computer science (it doesn't have software engineering). So if I make it into the public university, I would evaluate between the specific career of the private one and the economic help of the public one, and choose the most appropriate one.</p>

<p>However, reading their entrance rules, I saw that if I decline the offer of admission in the public one, I could not apply to it again for the next two admission cycles (at two per year, that means a year and a half). What is the philosophy behind this? Applying to several schools benefits  students, giving them more schools to choose from. And it also raises the funding because of the payment that is done to give the entrance exam (which is not one of the things public schools in my country can brag about). And it doesn't harm anyone, because the next one in the list would enter. The only collateral damage I can think of is extra administrative effort, but a year and a half vetted from applying to the university because of that seems too much for me. So, why? Is there some extra side effect that they are accounting for?</p>

<hr>

<p>The information @Pete L. Clark requested: I am living in Peru, and here the admission process in public universities is pretty simple: You just present your legal and education papers, pay for the entrace exam, take it, and see if you are admitted or not. So, everything boils down to that 3-days exam. But once it is finished, you are in.</p>

16759,"<p>In most (or at least many) fields of academia, peer-reviewed publications are essential.  For a compilation thesis, no papers means no PhD.  For tenure, you need papers.  To get grants, you need papers.  Universities may distribute internal funds based on the number of papers per group.  In short: <em>publish or perish</em>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is quite cheap to offer someone co-authorship.  Send a nearly finished manuscript to a colleague/friend at another university for review... colleague reads it, offers some advice, perhaps just minor.  First author offers co-authorship in return, and colleague has another co-authored paper for possibly less than a day of work.  One can discuss if it is the right thing to do, but that is not my question here.  It happens.</p>

<p>Criteria for co-authorship differ per field, but some papers have <em>a lot</em> of co-authors.  Perhaps due to having an instrument that was used in an inter-comparison/validation study.  Some examples of papers with lots of co-authors, not particularly extreme:</p>

<p>I also granted a national science scholarship last year, and was an exchange student at University of Colorado at Boulder. I did very well over there (3.9/4.0).</p>

<p>In my country, electrical engineering and electronic/computer(EECS) science are different. Electrical deals with power systems and telecomunications, while EECS deals with microelectronics, dsp, embedded systems, theory of computation and so on.</p>

<p>My home university doesn't have the EECS option so I had to choose electrical engineering, since I hadn't money to move to another place.</p>

<p>at CU Boulder, I basically only took classes in advanced math (even grad school level) that is my passion for life and computer science(another passion). Since I got back I'm not very motivated with my program, because I want to study EECS and math and not power systems.</p>

<p>Currently I'm attending the math summer program(summer here is January and February) at one of the leading math research institutes in my country(and even one of the best in the world) and I was invited to start the Master of Advanced Studies in March. They offered me a scholarship, so all my expenses will be covered. Since I didn't complete my undergrad studies yet, they offered to transfer my Engineering course to the school of engineering and math(ranked #1 nationally), and then after 2/2.5 years from march I'd have a bachelor's of electronic/computer science engineering, a second bachelor's degree in math and Master of Advanced studies in math. The only ""problem"" is that in the end, I'd have taken 7/7.5 years to complete my bachelor's of engineering program.</p>

<p>My question is the following: Will this ""long time"" for completing the engineering program harm my chances of being accepted by grad school, in math or computer science in a top graduate school? </p>

<p>May I argue in the applicant's form that I took 7.5 years because I moved on, I wasn't happy with my course/university, and when I chance to study my passions at the best schools in the country so I went forward ? (that would in fact be true)</p>

<p>My question is more directed towards the way one should contact potential advisors, specially if they are in foreign countries and a face-to-face meeting is not possible. Is it better to contact directly the Professor or rather contact fellow PhD/PostDocs of that laboratory ? Is an e-mail sufficient or should you try to contact that person through tools like LinkedIn or ResearchGate ?</p>

<p>What would be a good time to do so ? 3 months, 6 months, a year before finishing the PhD ?</p>

<p>Should one be specific on what you would like to work on or rather general so that more possibilities are available ?</p>

The first reviewer appointed the manuscript as ""publishable with corrections"" and gives recommendations. The second reviewer didn't like it at all and made harsh comments. It seems that the first reviewer went throughout a longer analysis of the manuscript (based on his careful comments), while the other discarded it quickly, without too many protocol.

The problem is that the topic itself was extensively studied in the past two decades and there's little maneuver space without overlapping with others' past ideas (it's in applied Computer Science). My adviser seems to be constrained by his grant committee to have a solution for the topic's problem using a certain kind of technique that will be outperformed by other, more specific algorithms right from the start.

In this time I have been applying for several post-doc and faculty positions all around the world. The following fortuitous situation has now developed:</p>

<ul>
<li>I was interviewed for a post doc position at a famed lab in Europe and received a job offer. This job offer is contingent on me getting security clearance for this lab and getting a long term visa. One of the ground rules laid out was I would not accept other post-doc positions.</li>
<li>Prior to this post-doc interview, I had interviewed for faculty position at US universities. Fortuitously a few weeks after this post-doc job offer, I have been offered full time faculty position at two other universities in the USA.</li>
<li>Now the reason I did apply for post-doc jobs is that they would help me build my network, publish more and help with an eventual faculty position!</li>
<li><strong>I am in some moral quandary now:</strong> I know that I have given the post-doc PI my word and I will not renege on it. However, the faculty positions are definitely more lucrative and long term.</li>
<li>I accepted the post-doc job because I was asked to make a decision soon and since I am a foreigner, timing is everything for me and a ""job in hand is worth two in the bush"" <code>Groans at quotation</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The options (likely and unlikely) that present themselves to me are:</p>

<li><strong>Likely:</strong> Angle for better pay/better title at the post-doc jobs.</li>

Being from the US where I have been in charge of structuring my own schedule (except for teaching), this obviously confuses me for several reasons. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, I am not sure if we are legally entitled to vacation days in the US, but even if we were, I have never seen people officially take ""vacations"" in the US. This is, in my mind what school administrative staff or office workers do, not academics. Over the past years, I have structured my work and vacation time around my teaching schedule and figured out when to rest and when to work on my own without having to count days or ask my department's permission. Of course nobody cares when I take vacations as long as my vacation time does not overlap with my teaching schedule. </p></li>
<li><p>So the fact that my new department is emphasizing ""legal vacation hours"" is a little strange. What does vacations mean when I will likely be spending whatever free time, rushing to finish my manuscript, grant proposals, or course prep anyways? </p></li>
<li><p>Also, does the fact that the school is counting vacation days mean that I have to be in my office during ""normal work hours""? I've never heard anything sillier, because for academics, number of hours in office does not equate productivity, and I actually like switching up my work location time to time rather than being stuck in an office! (In the US, I only show up to school about 3 days a week-- mostly when I have to teach and want to be in office. Other days, I just go to a local cafe to write. If possible, I'd like to keep things this way...)</p></li>

<p><strong>Story:</strong> </p>

<p>My friend (Mr. F) came to know from an advertisement published at some institution's notice board that a professor (Prof. P) is looking for a student to work in a project at his laboratory. So he sent curriculum vita to apply. Next morning he got a mobile phone call from Prof. P asking if he was really interested to work and he agreed. His home town is 2000 km (1243 miles) away form the institution. Prof P told Mr. F to arrange a railway ticket for this trip. Also Prof. P asked Mr. F not to send any mail. All arrangements (railway ticket, money etc) were completed and informed to Prof. P who told him that a letter will be sent for an interview in his department. Date of the interview will be fixed according to the date of his reaching which is already informed by Mr. F.</p>

<p>Seven days has gone. Prof. P did not sent any mail. Once Mr. F asked him by phone and inquired for this interview latter. Prof P told that ""Interview letter is not a matter, just come, you shall not face any problem, actually I am very busy.""</p>

<p>All the talks has done via telephone, no mail, so there is no proof that Prof P invited Mr. F or told him for travel arrangement.</p>

<p><strong>Question :</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>This is a problem of my friend's. However, your answers will also be helpful for me. <strong>Should Mr. F go without a printed document?</strong> What should he do now? He has no documentary proof. Shall he cancel all travel arrangements?</p></li>
<li><p>This is my question, and will be helpful for my friend for his next application. <strong>Should I remove telephone number from my curriculum vita next when I shall apply for such a post?</strong></p></li>

<p><strong>Edits after a few responces:</strong></p>

<p>Prof. P and Mr.F lives in different ends of India. Prof. P is a professor of a top Indian institution. Mr. F has completed M.Sc. degree from some another institution and is currently unemployed.</p>

<p>The Indian government has several funding agencies like DRDO, CSIR, DST, MHRD, NBHM, UGC, BNRS etc. They give research fund to some professors of different institutions and universities.   They can employ research fellows at their laboratory whose salary (generally Rs. 16000/ month) comes from this fund. The student may get a PhD degree if he can be able to join the PhD programme of the university or institution. But joining in a project work and joining in PhD programme are independent events. For joining a project he does not need to join in any programme on the institution, but he usually enjoys all the facilities like a PhD scholar. He may or may not get a travel salary for interview. In our case Mr.F may not get it as it is not mentioned in the advertisement.  </p>

16960,"<p>I am a PhD student. I've never taught a lecture-style course before. I just filled in for my advisor at the last minute, giving a lecture in an undergrad course.</p>

<p>I taught from the lecture slides that my advisor had prepared, drawing diagrams and examples on the whiteboard where I thought it was warranted. I stopped often and asked if anyone had questions, and if nobody did I posed questions to them, e.g., ""What do you think is the benefit of this system over that?"" ""What did you learn about X?""</p>

<p>My impression was that approximately 30% of the class was pretty engaged, asking and answering questions, etc., 50% were taking notes and paying attention but not really speaking up, and the rest were zoned out. I think this is normal (from what I remember from being an undergrad), so I thought I was doing OK. </p>

<p>However, towards the end of the lecture, a few students said that I was going much faster than normal. And, I did get through more slides than my advisor said I should expect to, so they're probably right.</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What clues do you look for to ""read a room"" to tell that you're going too fast, even though people seem to still be ""getting it""? </p>
  
  <p>What can you do to slow down, beyond asking if anybody has questions and bringing up more examples (I can only think of so many examples)?</p>

16973,"<p><strong>The Question:</strong> Do people in the industry consider HCI a non-technical field? Do they expect me to have more design and social science skills than technical ones? Finally, does having a PhD in HCI hinder my chances to achieving my career goal (see below)? If so, I might better leaving the program and get back to industry, or am I?</p>

<p><strong>My career goal</strong> is to end up in top notch software firms, as a software developer or data scientist. I also would like to start a business later on. Being a professor and/or researcher is not my ideal career (I don't hate it though, as long as I can be in the industry at the same time).</p>

<p><strong>The story:</strong> I am a PhD student in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). I am in my early second year of my studies, and have more than two more years to go (it is a 3-4 year program). As a technically oriented person, with a strong interest in CS theory and software development, I tried to define my research plan with major technical aspects, with a focus on machine learning. Even though I just have basic skills in ML, I think I can become pretty good at it during the course of my studies.</p>

<p>But recently I stumbled upon a job listing with hundreds of HCI related ads, many of them in major companies, and most of them expecting the applicants to have skills in UX, design, performing user studies etc, which is not what I want to end up doing.</p>

<p><strong>My background:</strong> I am 29, have been in the industry for 12 years (as a software developer and also hardware designer). Most part of my industry experience was in my home (a third world) country, which doesn't give me much recognition in developed countries. My main motivation of doing a PhD was that of credit, since the school is a world-wide top ten, and that of freedom in choosing the subject of my work. The offer (from a financial point of view, and for a PhD studentship) was very attractive, equal to a junior-mid level industrial position.</p>

It is concerned with managing/coordinating multiple research teams - something I'd like to do eventually but maybe at a later stage after gaining some more research/management experience as a postdoc.

16985,"<p>Having just spoke with my advisor, and speaking on occasion with other professors, I have come to the impression that one should not ""subpublish.""  Let me say what I mean.  I'm a 3rd year graduate student right now, and the professors I talk to seem to say that it is not a good idea to publish many small papers along the way to a result: that is, holding fixed the total mathematical content across <em>N</em> papers, it is best if <em>N</em> is minimized.  I was trying to understand why.  My advisor cited the reason of ""reputation"" and I have invented my own reason that perhaps there is an upfront cost to the process of writing and submitting a paper so that although effort per length may be constant, it is to my advantage to pay the upfront cost as few times as possible.  (Finding a referee is the only upfront cost that comes to mind, but keep in mind I've never done this before.)</p>

<p>Can someone expand upon how reputation is relevant here i.e. for <em>fixed mathematical content</em> why it looks bad to come out with many small papers?  Are there also benefits to the community or the knowledge pool that I'm trying to expand however slightly by writing such papers if it all comes at once in one big paper?  One would think that if I ""subpublish"" that actually since my results become available more immediately that it would benefit the community if I did so.  The only person it would seem to possibly hurt is me if I were to get scooped.</p>

16995,"<p>I am soon to finish a long PhD, and am thinking about postdoctoral applications. </p>

<p>As a PhD student I did a lot of quality work and have some publications in respected journals/conferences. However, I did not develop my own research ideas or objectives as a PhD student. This was just the state of affairs and there wasn't much I could do about it. Also, while my work so far is primarily applied and methodological, I am interested in theoretical work. I do not want to continue doing the kind of work I have done so far. </p>

<p>I have a couple questions under the theme of the title:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do I need to sell my PhD work as my own idea in a postdoc application, or is it reasonable to be honest?  </li>
<li>Will it arouse suspicion in an application to propose research in an area which is not closely related to my PhD research? </li>
<li>If I want to be able to develop my own ideas as a postdoctoral researcher, should I seek to clarify that goal, seek positions which advertise that option explicitly, or conceal that goal and instead simply do so once I have a position?</li>

<p>More general question:</p>

<ol>
<li>From my observation and reading, there's an art to developing a research objective/question. Ideally, I would like to have some kind of guidance in doing so. In my experience that is unrealistic. How can I seek meaningful mentorship, but somehow frame it in a manner that allows me to move forward and to maintain financial and intellectual freedom from the mentor?  </li>

The graduate works in a somewhat-related field, but is personally entirely unknown to me (I have some loose connections to the advisor, though). I was reasonably confused by this - I personally have never heard of a custom of sending physical theses to anybody besides maybe parents. I was 100% convinced that I received the dissertation in error (also because the mailing was addressed to my name, but using a wrong department name).</p>

And yet - perhaps due only to inattention, lack of sleep, or hunger - otherwise brilliant people sometimes manage to ask some pretty inane questions during talks. (""Yes, but how does the rover manage to drive around on the moon in the first place - shouldn't it just fall back down to Earth?"")  Or worse: make false or bizarre assertions. (""I don't see how your thrusters can possibly provide enough lift, given that the moon is made out of cheese!"")</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How do you answer these kinds of questions in a way that makes <em>everyone</em> feel good about the interaction?</p>

<p>There are sort of three parties to consider here: yourself, the person asking the question, and the rest of the audience.  You could, for instance, amuse and satiate the rest of the audience by poking fun at the person (""True, but why would you want to leave a paradise made of cheese?"").  Humor <em>might</em> win over the audience, but the person who asked the question will spend the rest of the time ignoring the talk and thinking about how little he likes you.  In contrast, you don't want to pander (""Ah, interesting point - I didn't realize the moon was made of cheese.  Is it Gruyère or some kind of Stilton?"") because, although the person asking the question now feels respected, the rest of the audience thinks you're a schmuck.</p>

There were other things that were unfortunate about that experience, but the best advice I have been given is that if I try to return to studies, I need to explain why I don't have a reference from my previous Ph.D. programs, and if I document things that were wrong, that comes across as ""<em>I am a negative person who will publicly backstab a university by criticizing it after exhausting his appeal options</em>"" rather than ""<em>XYZ happened and if you can document it, we will make accommodations.</em>"" (Additionally, I've tried to document the talent I have, but documenting that I am talented, no matter what talent I document, doesn't seem to trip any light bulbs of recognizing I may be a promising student.)</p>

17070,"<p>I value the reputation of the journals to which I submit articles. Mostly, I wish to confront my work with the most competent researchers in my field through peer review, in order to have an expert opinion on its quality. In my field, the best ranked/most reputable journals are dominantly subscription-based (although all offer 3'000$ open access (OA) options, that not many researcher choose). So I give priority to reputation/quality over OA policy. On the other hand, I'm well aware that subscription journals are a big weight on universities budget.</p>

<p>So, <strong>does OA* really help access to science and save taxpayer money?</strong></p>

<p>The arguments I know about that suggest it does: </p>

<p>I'm aware of the arguments (very efficiently publicized by big OA publishers like Frontiers) that OA is good karma because it gives access to science 'for free'. People argue that when the taxpayers pay for research, they should also get to read the results without paying a subscription.</p>

<p>Reasons for which I'm not sure it does:</p>

<p>I believe that if every article costs 500-3000$ just to publish, and the total number of article explodes, taxpayers (or private funds) are not winning a lot in the change. I also think that people can go to the library to get access to research.</p>

<p>Isn't it reasonable to use the options that we have to freely give access to our work (self-archiving, sending preprint to people who ask politely, etc.). </p>

<p>ps. I published in both OA and subscription-based, and I will gladly submit to OA journals if they end up being the highest quality ones in my field.</p>

I am in a graduate school and have two professors this semester both of who are telling me that they are not following any particular book, and yet when I pressed for some recommendations, they came up with some books.

Somehow, I found out the books which they are actually using and it turns out they are copying each and every example from that other ""a little less known book"" in the class. The assignments are also exercises from that book. </p>

The problem is if you are a theoretical/mathematical researcher in these lab based fields often your mathematical model and derivations are the crux of your research and a numerical exploration comes later. How do you write an abstract for these fields highlighting that you derived the model, proved a bunch of existence and uniqueness properties (that they likely don't care about) and have just started your exploration of numerical examples (likely the only thing they care about) without having anything definitive to say yet about your numerical examples.</p>

<p>The most definitive thing I could say about the numerical examples is, ""We show that for a given set of parameter space we observe X and for another set of parameter space we observe Y. This is the consequence of X being true in contrast to Y being true in our field of application"".

<p>Considering the publication of a paper prior to peer-reviewed publication on the ArXiv (or another preprint server), there are usually two main positions considering a possible theft of the idea (or somebody coming up with the same idea):</p>

<ul>
<li>If somebody manages to publish your idea in a peer-reviewed journal before you do, you can prove that you came up with the idea first or at least independently if you have published your paper on the ArXiv. Therefore it is a good idea to publish papers on the ArXiv before they have been published in a peer-reviewed journal.</li>
<li>If you publish your paper on ArXiv before it is published in a peer-reviewed journal, others may steal your work and publish it peer-reviewed before you do and thus take the scientific credit. It’s difficult to attack those people since the ArXiv is not peer-reviewed. Somebody could make a living of plagiarising ArXiv papers. Therefore it is a bad idea to publish papers on the ArXiv before they have been published in a peer-reviewed journal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there any <strong>example cases</strong> (or even studies) supporting either of these statements? For example, has a peer-reviewed journal ever withdrawn a paper because it plagiarised an ArXiv paper? Or are there well-known cases of “unpunished” plagiarism of ArXiv papers? Less extreme examples or even claims of plagiarism that happened this way are welcome, too.</p>

<p>Note that it is really examples and not theoretical analysis of the statements, I am looking for.

However, debating about these viewpoints on a theoretical basis or attacking some of the premises is usually futile.)</p>

17175,"<p>I work in a lab. This evening, thinking that my advisor had already left for the day, I started telling my peers in the lab that she has a bad attitude about a few things, and she was showing off a lot about her work last summer. Out of nowhere, she walked into the lab and was visibly upset. I feared that she had heard what I said. She suddenly started asking us what we had done with out projects so far this week (we usually do this only on Mondays.) This action bothered me a great deal.  </p>

<p>Also, I just finished my masters and had asked my advisor about pursuing a PhD. She kind of gave an OK and I am supposed to meet with her tomorrow morning to discuss about it.  Although our relationship has been on and off at times, I feel bad because she helped me a lot in past and now she will feel I am an ungrateful bas_ard.</p>

<p>What will be the best way to approach this issue so that I can minimize the damage to our relationship? Should I bring up in tomorrow's meeting and how?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2-21:</strong> <em>So my advisor said she doesnt has funding so she cant take me as a PHD Candidate, which i know is load of crap( the Dept. funds 1st year of PHD by the way for non tenure professors and she does have projects ) , she has lot of money. I may probably never know why she didnt want me but as one of the answers advised  , i thanked her for keeping me funded through out 2 years and i bought closure upon myself. I am just torn ,depressed ,angry ,tearful because i worked for this advisor for 2 years and i thought when leaving she would atleast give me a correct reason or put me up in a job somewhere or recommend me somewhere ( i was promised i would be shown a job beacuse i did thesis) ,i am just left to hang in the wind. But the other distnguished research professor was very happy to have me in his lab. This relationship was for 2 years and even though i may have said few words ,i dont think that long of a relationship should end on a lie. Anyways thanks everybody. The ground has been pulled from under my feet but i hope everythign turns out best in my life.</em></p>

17199,"<p>Last year I have been submitting my CV to different faculties for a lecturing position. Of all the ones that I applied only one was more serious and wanted to keep in touch (institution A), the other one (institution B) was completely silence and only they reply with a general ""we are interested, but we will tell you when there are open positions"". Actually the following has happened:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Institution A has offered me a full time position with good salary, and the freedom to make research or even to work in other places part time.</p></li>
<li><p>Institution B contact me a few days before the offer of institution A, telling me that they would like me to work part time with them; when I told them that I would like to have a full time position they started to tell me ""that procedure is going to take time"". A couple of days passed and I got the offer from the job that I mentioned in the first point.</p></li>
<li><p>Now last week Institution B called me and they told me that they want not only to offer me a full time position, but also a position as a student coordinator of the career. The drawbacks are: the salary is 14% less than A, the hours are not; fixed that means that one should stay for overtime unpaid if the goals have not been reached, the research is keep to the minimum and I will not have the chance to work in another place part time. The only benefit is that I will be have a higher rank than in A. This same institution has already booked me for some partial hour lecturers in a couple of courses. I have been sincere with them when they called me and I told them that I have been offered another position (from institution A), so I need to wait to their answer. Even with that institution B has continue insisting me for getting the job with them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So by factors of time, research and money; institution A seems a pretty good choice, but how I can reject politely the offer from B without being ""marked"" for not working there or not to burn bridges with them. Maybe somebody could say ""why I do not want to burn bridges with them?, well it is just to have like a backup plan. Also institution B has the story that they are used to cut off their lecturers at any time they want, so what to do?</p>

17209,"<p>This forum looks like the perfect place to ask a question that is being bothering me for a long time.</p>

<p>I'm 22 and a college dropout for numerous reasons (economic and mostly because I didn't like the major that I was studying, which led to depression, etc.) 
Anyway, I recently discovered MOOCs (coursera, edx, udacity, OCW-MIT, etc.) and khanAcademy and I immediately fell in love with science and more precisely computer science. I also fall in love with the brain and love to think about thinking, decision making, logic, critical thinking, neuroplasticity, etc...
I also appreciated cognitive psychology and the philosophy of the mind but I haven't gone any deeper to those two.
So, you can say MOOCs changed my life because I'm able to learn things that I never would have consider ever studying.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of pursuing a Cognitive Science degree which can expose me into computer science and some kind of neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology.</p>

<p>The only thing is that here in Greece, Cognitive Science is only a postgraduate degree so I have first to finish an undergraduate degree in Computer Science or in Philosophy and History of Technology (those are the only two majors from which students are accepted for the Cognitive Science degree).</p>

<p>My question is, should I spend the next year of my life into studying for a test that will get me to the University (in order to get to a University you need to give exams in May, I'm not ready to give it this May so I have to give it on the May of 2015)?</p>

<p>Is it worth it to study Computer Science for four years to pursue the Cognitive Science degree which is my primary goal ?</p>

<p>PS: The possibility of studying abroad is out of question given the economic situation of my family, unless a scholarship for studying abroad is available.</p>

17253,"<p>Progression in academia, in general, seems and feels extremely linear, i.e. you do your undergrad, then you do graduate studies, then you do a post-doc (or two, or three ... ) and eventually if you are good/persistent/well-connected/... enough you might get funded to start your own group and live the rest of your professional life in chasing grants, fighting with faculty and editors etc [<em>yes, I am exaggerating</em>], which I dont find particularly appealing. </p>

<p>Alternative to this scenario is to quit academia and go to the industry, often labeled as ""selling out"" by senior scientists I have personally met and discussed this subject with. </p>

<p>But life in general never gives a clear bisections, like you do either A or B, but there are typically a number of options to choose from. Thus I figure there should be some shades of gray in between the white and black. As a resource to other doctoral students I figured we could perhaps accumulate the possible career paths for people that have finished their PhDs, besides trying to climb up the ladder of academic ascension. </p>

<p>The ones I can think of are: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>specialized (lab) technician:</strong> working for instance with complex instruments. I have noticed in our lab that having an experienced technician operating and maintaining the heavy instruments is invaluable for the group. Not only for the sake of projects going as smooth as possible, but also for teaching grad students how to properly use the instruments. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>popular science author/editor:</strong> I have read quite a few popular science books by people with PhDs on fields that I know little about (here's <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1851688331"">a good example</a>). Similarly, magazines such as Illustrated Science typically need a middle layer between cutting-edge science and interested (but not adequately educated) readers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>research position at industry:</strong> I am really going on a limb here, as I don't personally know anyone who is actively doing just that, but companies in several different fields actually do research; either in collaboration with universities, or in-house. I am inclined to think that such a position would include less grant-seeking, and publishing headaches (perhaps replaced with other types of headaches).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>production position at industry:</strong> from what I understand this is the more typical scenario where people that go to industry after doing a PhD end up in. Based on my discussions with people (in academia) these positions typically include little to none intellectual development or acquisition of new skills. Thus not-so-desired or looked-down-upon by academics.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My question(s):</p>

<ol>
<li>what other career paths are there, that I might have missed?</li>
<li>am I correct in my understand of the above 4 paths? are there any insights that you would like to add? </li>

<p>Currently I am working on my Bachelor's Degree in mathematics. I've always wanted to take part in the development of what may be termed ""connectionist AGI"", so I am already trying to acquire some knowledge in related fields by reading books/papers (e.g. about neuroscience and neural nets) and following <a href=""http://www.cis.temple.edu/~wangp/Writing/AGI-Curriculum.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Pei Wang's ""AGI Curriculum""</a>.</p>

<p>I intend to do my Master's Degree in biomathematics, but I'm not quite sure what to do afterwards. </p>

<p>I have already thought of a PhD in <strong>neuroscience</strong> (so I can get a deeper understanding how the brain actually works, in order to apply this to models), however this seems to be ""too medical"" (I'd rather do some thinking instead of dissecting brains).</p>

<p>Apart from that I could imagine doing a PhD in <strong>cognitive science</strong> or <strong>mathematics</strong> may be useful as well, however I'm not sure to what extend this is going to help me with developing AI.</p>

<p>Am I missing an obvious (and adequate) field? What do you think would be most useful?</p>

<p>Also, I've noted that some universities have traditions in adhering to a certain side in debates of principles (e.g. neat vs. scruffy as Stanford vs. MIT) - so far I have not been able to figure out if there's any university where the majority of professors advocate some kind of ""radical sub-symbolic and connectionist"" approach to AGI.</p>

<p>Long story short: I'm an international student, and I recently completed my master's degree in CS. I had been working with one adviser (Prof A), I completed my course work in December, but since Prof A couldn't find worthy candidates to fill my place, Prof A told me that if I assist her with her research projects for one more semester, she will help me find a job. Fast forward two months, she told me in a meeting that she tried to help but she can't and that I should look for a job on my own. I recently asked if I could pursue a PhD in her lab. She said no, as she has no funding. I've successfully applied to a different lab (Prof B), only to find out that all professors are provided funding for first-year graduate students. <strong>Why would she lie about this? Is this normal?</strong></p>

<p>The situation has since developed that I've been able to play my acceptance to Prof B's lab off of Prof A, and she was very happy to take me on now that I'm working on B's research; she clearly hopes to get research funding out of this new-found collaboration. This seems incredibly callous to me; she clearly has no interest in my situation, and simply wants more grant money. <strong>Is this normal behavior for academics?</strong> I was on the edge of being deported, and she clearly could not care less about my personal situation, only for her research money. <strong>Are all academics this callous?</strong></p>

Due to a change in areas half way through my PhD, I find myself at the end of my training with no significant publications. I have one in press, and several in prep so in the next year I should have 3-4 if all goes well. I'm also at a top ten university in the US and have good recommendation letters etc...</p>

<p>My issue is: I need to get a job as soon as possible <strong>in Europe</strong> to be with my partner. I have applied to both post-docs and to some assistant professorships at smaller schools in his city thinking I should at least try but I'm feeling seriously under-competitive where the norm in my field is at least three papers by graduation.</p>

<p>I have an option to stay on as a grad student for a 6th year at my institution, but it would have to be remotely (as I will move to Europe anyway) and frankly, I don't want to have to do that (both because it's too hard to do research and I make little money). But it is a safe option, and might give me time to write up all the backlogged data I've recently acquired.</p>

<p><strong>So my options are to take an extra year with very little pay and apply later, or apply extensively and effortfully to jobs that will probably reject me, though there is a small chance I'll get one.</strong></p>

<p>In your experience, will people even consider PhD's with very few pubs, or impending pubs, and if so, are there things I can do to make my application look more competitive, e.g. should I explain myself (I don't want to make excuses though) or highlight grants and presentations?</p>

<p>Or should I just cut my losses and suffer through living abroad with no money and taking the extra time I would have spent applying to a million places to write up a bunch of papers and then try again next year with more confidence and competence, and maybe landing a better job?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>UPDATE: I ended up getting short-listed for five institutions, two of which are top-tier, and ultimately was offered two assistant professorships and one post-doc. I am sure I would have been better off with more pubs but I'm glad I ended up applying for reach jobs as ultimately I think I ended up with some great choices, met a lot of people in the field, and most importantly, got a job!</p>

Their <a href=""http://journals.aps.org/copyrightFAQ.html#eprint"" rel=""nofollow"">copyright FAQ</a> is, I feel, not clear enough on the subject, and it's not quite clear how I should contact them about this.</p>

<p>The relevant paragraphs from the copyright transfer agreement are, I think</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2. The nonexclusive right, after publication by APS, to give permission to third parties to republish print versions of the Article or a translation thereof, or excerpts therefrom, without obtaining permission from APS, provided the APS-prepared version is not used for this purpose, the Article is not republished in another journal, and the third party does not charge a fee. If the APS version is used, or the third party republishes in a publication or product charging a fee for use, permission from APS must be obtained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4. The right to post and update the Article on free-access e-print servers as long as files prepared and/or formatted by APS or its vendors are not used for that purpose. Any such posting made or updated after acceptance of the Article for publication shall include a link to the online abstract in the APS journal or to the entry page of the journal. If the author wishes the APS-prepared version to be used for an online posting other than on the author(s)’ or employer’s website, APS permission is required; if permission is granted, APS will provide the Article as it was published in the journal, and use will be subject to APS terms and conditions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The latter one looks pretty inclusive, but it does not specify whether all licensing schemes for e-print servers are acceptable or not. Similarly, in their  I am worried, in particular, by a note in the <a href=""http://arxiv.org/help/license"" rel=""nofollow"">arXiv license help page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Creative Commons Attribution license in particular, permits commercial reuse and thus conflicts with many journal agreements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In particular, posting to an e-print server may be construed as overstepping the rights granted by point 2 of the agreement, since it can be used by a third party as permission to republish it in print and charge a fee for it. If that is the only objection, then choosing a <a href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/"" rel=""nofollow"">CC Noncommercial-ShareAlike</a> license would be compatible with the above.</p>

Basically, the research experience is the most important factor for me to decide my college, since I want to be a strong applicant in PhD admission. Most reputable, research universities are far larger than LACs (liberal arts colleges), and they (except for top schools like HYPSM) are not so friendly places for those who want to conduct their own research and engage in research from Sophomore or even Freshman.

Just for example, Reed College has mandatory Senior thesis like Princeton, and profs are eager to help even Sophomores to do their research.

17405,"<p><strong>Main concern:</strong> I am looking at PhD programs in Germany and the UK (vs US programs). Ideally, I would like to end up at a small liberal arts college (I got my BA from one). So I know I want a program with teaching requirements. I think this rules out France and Switzerland, but I believe many German PhD programs have teaching requirements. I also think the UK has teaching opportunities as well. </p>

<p><em>Are there other factors I should be thinking about?</em> </p>

<p><strong>Specific Concerns I've thought of</strong></p>

<p>First, am I wrong in my assumption that there are only small liberal arts colleges in the US? Or are there places in Europe, where you can get the same research, teaching, and mentorship balance? </p>

<p>I know that liberal arts departments are smaller. Should I be worried that a foreign school that is good in my field might not be known in the department that I am applying to?</p>

<p>Also, I had a friend at Oxford, who said that she would need to do a postdoc (in a field that doesn't normally require them), because US universities will not see her 2 year masters + 3 year PhD, as equivalent to a master + 5 year PhD in the US. I'm in the sciences and my field doesn't normally require a masters. Should I also be concerned? </p>

<p><strong>Reasons</strong>
I am currently a Master student in a European program that allows us to do research in multiple countries (theoretically anywhere that will take us, but we have specific connections to France, Germany, and Switzerland). So far I really like the science culture here. I like how easy it is to collaborate with and even work in different labs. In my experience, PhD students in the US just don't have the mobility that EU students. I have an interdisciplinary focus, so this is very attractive to me. I also am interested in a very specific topic and there is better funding for it in Germany and (I think) in the UK. </p>

<p>In the US, it is hard to find a school with more than one lab working on the topic, I'm most interested in, so I like the idea of applying to the lab rather than the school. I am willing to consider working on related areas, but I'm not sure if I can spend 5 to 7 years working on something that is only tangential to my main interests.

17425,"<p>I asked a similar question last year, but the stakes have changed slightly.</p>

<p>So, I have an offer from a top 5 program in Chemical engineering (my major). There are a couple of extremely accomplished professors in fluid mechanics here, which is what I want to study in grad school. However, I am not so interested in attending this school for graduate school because it does not send many people to academia post-graduation, despite being a top 5 program, mostly because it isn't a very big name school. Or at least I assume this is the reason.</p>

<p>The deadline to reply to this school is March 5th. </p>

<p>To complicate things, I am waiting on a reply from a much more prestigious university for a summer internship. While the school has a much better name, its ranking is slightly less (number 6 for chemical engineering). I think I have a very good chance of getting this internship (my PI went to grad school here and wrote a very strong letter, plus I have a good resume otherwise). However, I learned today that they will NOT be able to get a response back to me before March 5th.</p>

<p>I am much more interested in attending School 2 (slightly lower rank, better name), because they very frequently send people to academia, which is my long term goal.</p>

<p>School 1 (higher rank, worse name) was pretty firm in the March 5th date, so I don't think I can ask for an extension.</p>

<p>Financially, School 1 offered me a slightly better deal, I'd be netting about 2k more over 10 weeks. However, that isn't as important to me, since the experience is worth far more than the money.</p>

<p>I apologize for the long question, but any advice or guidance would be appreciated. Am I putting too much emphasis on the name and rank? I don't want to be greedy and put all of my eggs in School 2's basket, and be left with nothing if I end up not getting it after all.</p>

<p>Inspired by this <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/a/17475/10094"">answer by Suresh</a> as well as some recent discussions I had in completely other contexts (e.g., founding startups, or even building decks in trading card games), I am wondering whether the scientific community is historically too hung up on the question of who <em>came up with an idea first</em> in contrast to <em>who made an idea work</em>. See, for instance in the startup world, nobody really cares about who had an idea for e.g., a social network first. The fame (and money, in that case) goes to the person that was sufficiently convinced of the idea to go the extra mile and really make it work. In research, similar things sometimes happen (researcher A has the original raw idea, but researcher B develops it further and popularizes it, and consequently gets the credit), but in our context this is often assumed to be a failure of the system.</p>

<p>In my field, I think we are actually seeing a lot of bad sideeffects of the notion that the initial idea is the important part of research, and not its implementation. Basically all venues that I review for are swamped with half-baked ""A First Step Towards XY"" style papers, which really serve no other purpose than trying to establish precedence for an (often very abstract and general) idea. I have seen researchers who made it to full professor without ever really following up on any idea. They just jump on each new bandwagon, throw out a bunch of position and high-level papers, and complain hefty about ""precedence"" whenever somebody else implements one of those ideas.</p>

<p>So my question is:</p>

<p><strong>Is there a clear reason why in science ideas are considered more important than implementations? Should this be true for every field? Shouldn't we start to give more credit to people that spend time on weeding out the good from the terrible ideas?</strong></p>

17512,"<p>I've recently obtained my PhD in mathematics and started a post-doc this year. I have 5 published papers, across a wide spectrum of journals (in terms of quality, from very good to mediocre). However I never received any off-prints from the journals and it seems that to receive those one has to pay. On the other hand all the professors that I know of have always a lot of off-prints for most of their journal publications. I always wanted to have these neat looking off-prints but it seems that the winds have changed and journals are becoming ""cheaper"" (behavior-wise) than ever.</p>

<p>This leads me to the following question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this a recent change? Is it considered the norm now to not send off-prints free of charge?</li>
<li>Are these professors perhaps ordering the off-prints through some departmental fund?</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there anything that can be done about this situation? Can I pressure the journal into sending me off-prints free of charge (e.g would trying to refuse signing the publishing agreement, unless they provide the off-prints for free work?). Have people tried boycotting journals not offering off-prints? This kind of cheap behavior really strikes me as pushing the boundary of what is acceptable. Not only we do most of the work for the journal (refereeing, writing, etc.) but on top of that journals are expensive and do not even offer off-prints anymore.</p>

<p>I did a masters research project as part of a grant project my professor received. Her project was to redo a standard, widely design using a new technology as a feasibility comparison, to see if the technology should be adapted as an accepted (possibly standard) design. My thesis project was to redesign key part of the original design in order to provide her with design parameters; we then iterated over each design twice more to finalize on common parameters.</p>

<p>It took a couple months to get clear criteria from the sponsor, and we finished a couple months behind schedule, but ultimately our work was a success. Our work was combined in a single dual report to serve as both my thesis and her official report.</p>

<p>Following my successful defense, with no changes from my committee, she bluntly refused to sign off on my graduation paperwork until she had official acceptance of the report from the entity funding the grant. She admitted this was an entirely separate issue but ""wanted something to hold over my head in case they ask for changes"". This delayed my graduation significantly, which has had serious consequences for my professional career. As far as I can tell, the was done solely for her benefit to secure full grant payment (to her) and not as any part of the school's needs or my graduation requirements.

<p>Following the <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/q/17551/12468"">(delayed) approval of my thesis paperwork by my professor</a>, the review staff of my small (~20 grad students?) department took weeks to give me each round of revisions. After the second revision, having already had my thesis for nearly the entire semester, the reviewer admitted to ""forgetting"" about my paperwork for over a month. She followed that up by telling me she was shelving my paperwork to ""focus on other students who still have a chance of graduation this semester."" Even though I should have graduated the semester previous, and had been waiting months for her to finish the review so I could get my thesis bound (required by the graduation process).</p>

<p>The reviewer was fired shortly after the end of that semester, the new reviewer and I got it finished up in just over a week, and the dean of the college wrote a letter to the graduate school requesting my graduation be back-dated. This was refused with only blanket statements about 'policy'. Obviously I should have escalated the issue much sooner, but I wasn't world-weary enough to realize that ""the people in charge"" were being so negligent and unprofessional, or to realize that I could do anything about it. I think students in general are often too intimidated by the people in the 'ivory tower' to speak out and ask for better treatment.</p>

My official graduation was therefore graduated <em>a full year after my defense</em>. Due to the concurrent program I was in, this meant my undergraduate degree also did not post until that date - <em>2.5 years after I finished my undergraduate classes</em>. As my profession requires 4 years of <em>post-degree</em> training for licensing, this has significantly delayed my professional career. If not for delays beyond my control by school personnel, I would have had time to complete the graduation paperwork and finish my degree a full year earlier.</p>

He contacted the dean of the graduate school, who refused to even hear the case - all that he or I ever got back from the graduate school was blanket statements about 'policy', which I presume meant their own and not some oversight body. Even when I (repeatedly) went to the graduate office in person, the (brand new) graduate dean refused meet with me.

<p>Moreover, I have been late in turning in my thesis for several semesters since I've also been working full time much of the time after I finished my B.S.. This makes it feel like my university does not really care about my success anymore and I am not even being pressured to finish writing my thesis as I would have been if I was a full-time student. </p>

<p>I will be finishing writing my thesis on this new topic, but much of the work I have done have not been checked by anyone with a Ph.D. This worries me. Should I just crowd-source some comments for editing my thesis from friends and try to just get it turned in and accepted so I can present? Or should I seek out more professors who are more familiar with this new topic and try to have them read it (it would take at least several hours to do this and, keep in mind, I am not a full-time or even part-time student right now)? </p>

<p>I think my work is good and I will pursue trying to get it published in a journal once my actual M.S. is done, so I am not too uncomfortable with the things I've written. </p>

17630,"<p>I really need some opinions/advice on my situation.</p>

<p><strong>My background</strong></p>

<p>I'm studying for my master degree in mathematics. I have always (since I was 14) wanted to do my own research one day. As I grew older, I knew that mathematics was what I wanted to do. So I went to the university to study mathematics. After having encountered a course in group theory I knew that I belonged to the algebraic part of mathematics. I did my bachelor project in group theory and when I became a graduate student (September 2013), I took courses and made a project supporting my interest in algebra.</p>

<p>Along the way I created the vision that I would finish my master degree as a dedicated student in algebra. In order to realize this vision my plan was to study abroad for one semester taking new algebraic courses.</p>

<p><strong>The situation</strong></p>

<p>My situation today is that my study abroad semester begins tomorrow. As mentioned my dream is to do my own research, but more generally/important: <em>I want to develop new ideas and be dedicated to something and I would love to follow/explore my passion.</em></p>

<p>My first thought (as many other students): I should get a PhD. So I did some research and figured out that there was an available position at the university I'm currently studying at in geometric group theory.</p>

<p>I don't know much about geometric group theory, but I do know that I love group theory. <strong>So I would really like to know if this is an opportunity or if I should just forget it.</strong></p>

<p>I don't want to pursue a PhD for anything in this world. I just want to stay focus on creating a meaningful work life around my passion.</p>

<p>Any advice?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Further remarks</strong></p>

<p>I'm a student from Denmark and I'm studying abroad in Austria for one semester. After my study abroad semester I still have to study one year for my master degree in Denmark. However this year consists of a half year with elective courses and a half year where I'm making my master's thesis. </p>

<p>I don’t know much about the PhD position. I found it from a Google search (: “PhD position group theory”). There is only given a starting date and an e-mail address for contact. I’m going to attend a course held by the supervisor of the project, so the whole thing is a coincidence. </p>

<p>I have investigated my opportunities for a position at my home university. One of my supervisors, a professor in group theory, told me that he couldn't offer me a position, since it was a question about money, but would like to recommend me. I don't think the university accepts PhD students without a master degree and the positions are without project descriptions.</p>

<p>However there is also another university (in Denmark) with a talent program where it is possible to get a PhD position without having a master degree. I contacted them and they told me I should apply after my study abroad semester (because I would have a stronger profile). But I don't know my chances.</p>

17658,"<p>We have undertaken a small statistical study of M.S. students in our department, including their application information and their eventual performance in our program. The goal is to develop criteria for making admissions decisions for new applicants based on their likelihood of success in our program (as predicted by the performance of recent, similar students). I won't get into the details of the methodology.</p>

<p>One outcome of this study was that different attributes predict success for students with undergrad degrees from different countries. For example, for applicants to the program from schools in country X, but not schools in country Y, undergrad GPA is correlated with the  students' GPA in our program; for schools in country Y, but not X, GRE scores are correlated with the student's GPA in our program. (I'm simplifying a lot here.) A ""toy"" example I just <em>completely made up</em> to illustrate is shown below:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/xJzc4.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>(of course, for real applicants the criteria and the relationships are more complicated)</p>

<p>There are many possible reasons for this: for example, we could think that the grading system is more consistent in X so undergrad GPA is a better predictor there, and in X students study ""for the exam"" so the GRE becomes virtually meaningless as a measure of knowledge. I could speculate, but I don't think it would be helpful. The bottom line is, we find that different factors predict student success among different populations.</p>

<p>Therefore, if we wanted to admit students based on their likelihood of achieving a certain GPA in our program, we would apply an undergrad GPA cutoff for students from X, and a GRE threshold for students from Y. (Again, this is vastly simplified from the criteria our study actually suggested.) </p>

<p><strong>Is it fair to apply different criteria to students with undergrad degrees from different countries in admissions decisions?</strong></p>

<p>Does the answer change if this would significantly skew the admissions decisions in favor of a particular country of undergrad study (because statistically, applicants to our program whose undergrad degrees are from X have done much better than those with undergrad degrees from Y).</p>

<p>My concern is that we're effectively saying, ""Students with undergrad degrees from Y with a GRE score &lt; T will be rejected, but students with undergrad degrees from X  with GRE &lt; T may still be considered for admission (pending other criteria)."" </p>

<p>On the other hand, if we ignore these statistics and reject students with undergrad degrees from X with low GRE scores, we are rejecting applicants even though we have no valid reason to believe that they won't do well in our program.</p>

<p><strong>To those who doubt the results of the study:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When I say the study is ""small"" I don't mean it isn't statistically significant - just that it was not designed to be generalizable beyond our applicant pool. (This is the same reason why I won't give too many details about the study - I don't want anybody to read it and try to generalize from our results.)</li>
<li>As we know, the sample size is not the only factor that determines whether a given effect is significant. We found that the results are significant, given the sample size.</li>
<li>The results also seem ""sane"" (which of course is subjective). It's not unexpected that undergraduate grading standards (and the standard-ness of grading standards) differ by country; or that different educational systems and cultures prepare students differently for standardized exams like the GRE and TOEFL; etc. The specifics of the results (i.e., which criteria are good predictors for which undergrad country) are consistent with what students who studied in those countries have told us about grading standards, student culture, and exam prep. So, we really have no reason to doubt them.</li>

<p>Now I’m in a new post-doc position, my student email has about 6 months left to run before everything is deleted when the account is closed, and which probably contains several thousand carefully filed emails (academic collaborations and correspondence, supervision and PhD project, university milestones, passwords, agreements...).

17731,"<p>There are various questions (and excellent answers) here about what to do when one accepts a job regarding existing applications. The general consensus is ""withdraw existing applications"".</p>

<p>I write with a variation on this that I have not seen addressed here.</p>

<p>If someone accepts a soft-money research position at one institution, and that position will start in 1.5 or 2 years, must they still withdraw and cease applying to other institutions?</p>

<p>Some context: The current role is post-doc. The goal is TT. The soft-money research position is a good step and starts when the post-doc ends. </p>

<p>It seems strange the candidate is effectively removed from the job market for ~2 years (1.5 until position starts, and one assumes it is bad form to apply for other jobs immediately in a new position), even though the next position is not committing to salary. It seems like other TT applications that are pending, or new ones that might be submitted in the next 1.5 years, could lead to the desired TT job, in which case the soft-money position would not be taken.</p>

<p>Is this approach unethical?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> </p>

<p>Soft money is a common term in my field. It means the institution provides no fixed long-term salary support. You are responsible for your salary by grant-writing.</p>

17739,"<p>A <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/17718/campus-dress-codes-for-a-student-in-university"">question</a> about university dress codes reminded me of an incident that happened when I was an undergrad, in which a classmate came to school wearing a really offensive and <strong>misogynistic</strong> t-shirt.</p>

<p>I was <em>extremely</em> uncomfortable, especially since this was an engineering program and I was one of only three or four female students in a class of about fifty. I had another class with the same student later that day and he was still wearing the shirt. I remember wishing at the time that a faculty member or <em>someone</em> with more authority than me would do something about it. </p>

<p>So, my question is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should a professor intervene if a student in their class is wearing clothing that is likely to be offensive and hostile to other students? If so, how?</li>
<li>If yes: are there any scenarios in which a professor should <em>not</em> do anything even though a student's clothes contains material that is hostile towards another student or group of students?</li>
</ul>

<p>And finally,</p>

<ul>
<li>If I come across this scenario as a TA, in which a student (who may be a peer in my program of study) in my class is wearing something offensive, what can I do about it? I don't feel comfortable (or safe, for that matter) as a woman confronting a male student about an item of clothing that is offensive to women. On the other hand, I feel like it is my responsibility to keep a non-hostile environment in my classroom.</li>

At this point, I'm trying to decide whether to take graduate level theoretical math courses in areas like Algebraic Topology, Differential Geometry, etc. (which I don't currently have any experience with, but I could still take), or just take courses in application areas (the ones I'm interested in are statistics, biology, chemistry, computer science). My math education in the latter case will consist of basic linear algebra+calculus, a course on PDEs, a course on abstract algebra, a complex analysis course with an applied focus, a couple mathematical modeling courses, basic number theory, basic probability theory, a couple numerical analysis courses, and upper-level real analysis. So not a ton, but not negligible either. There's also a lot of math in the non-math courses I will take (algorithms, theory of computing, quantum mechanics, optimization, stochastic processes, machine learning, etc., some of which are grad-level) However, this schedule is perhaps lighter on mathematical theory, and contains zero grad math classes. Should I drop some of the courses in application areas (although courses with significant mathematical content that yet focus on applications are perhaps my favorite type of courses) and take graduate-level theory courses to increase my readiness for and chances of getting accepted to graduate school? Or will I have ample time for that in graduate school and should I take courses I enjoy more (and have greater aptitude for) while informally studying theory on my own? Or do I need to take more theory even as an undergrad, and even though I'm not gunning for pure maths? (I do not plan to go into academia after graduate school, in case that matters.)</p>

17763,"<p>I teach undergraduate level courses in the humanities. Following practice in my department, I have let students take their texts for consultation during their written exams. They can choose a number of questions they want to answer from a set of questions. After a few semesters, I have begun questioning the validity of such an approach. </p>

<p>I usually had one exam in this form and one final essay in the end of the semester. The issue is, although the subject dealt with in the first part of the course is more or less objective, I find students ""copying"" my classes much more than using the texts to answer the questions. A complicating factor is that most students cannot presumably understand the material, available only in English. To make it clear, most of my students cannot read English (I could mention the material is not available at the library, but that is another matter). And it is a required course.</p>

<p>What bothers me is that with this approach I cannot, as suspected, measure the level of understanding of the students. Some of the questions deal with very basic issues and concepts. Even then, the overall level of reading, understanding, and writing, as evidenced by their exams and final essays, is very low.</p>

<p>I have thought about changing the syllabus next semester, to one exam (without consultation), perhaps another exam and the final written assignment, but I am quite unsure of the results. Perhaps a lot of students will fail. </p>

I had an irrelevant sociology major and graduated with a 2.9 GPA mainly because I had no inclination that I would ever want to go to graduate school and thought it was more important to just make sure that I had a job to support myself and graduated on time.</p>

<p>After graduation I had a crappy office job for 2 years and took some random IT graduate courses which lead me to eventually get a job as a programmer at a large marketing firm for about a year and I got really interested in the more complex world of computer science especially computer vision, modeling and simulation. </p>

<p>Which brings me to now.</p>

<p>I will be beginning a CS Master's program this summer at a medium sized state university with a concentration in Modeling and Sim.  I plan to to the thesis option and I've already begun contacting professors about research opportunities.</p>

<p>My GRE score is 162/155/4.5 but I didn't study because I found out I had to take it at the last minute.  With some prep I think I can at least bring that up to about 165/160/5.</p>

<p>All that said, do you think that with my thesis, a publication or 2 and a stellar GPA my masters work would over-shaddow my crappy undergraduate career enough to get me into a good PhD program.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>In the academia, it seems to me that the most popular languages are C/C++ and Python (if we neglect MATLAB and other vendor-specific languages). The language where I have seen the most amazing pieces of junk is actually C++. The main points are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Really, really naive C++ code. They claim they chose C++ over Java/Python/whatever because ""it's faster"", but they <code>new</code> everything, even an array of 3 floats that is deallocated few lines later, where 3 is known at compile time.</li>
<li>They have learned pointers from C and they use only them.</li>
<li>Some of them (not most of them) have read some random blog posts about OOP and now put <em>virtual</em> everywhere, using abnormal levels of abstraction.</li>
<li>They are convinced of pointless optimization choices.</li>
<li>They lack proper memory management.</li>
<li>They copy/paste massive amounts of code from project to project and within the same project as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>And in this list I am omitting the problems with the <em>process</em>, rather than the product. Scientists use:</p>

<ul>
<li>no version control,</li>
<li>no automated builds,</li>
<li>no documentation,</li>
<li>no software process at all (neither <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development"">agile</a>, nor traditional <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model"">waterfall</a>).</li>

After going through it I looked up the author, who is a professor of women's studies.  She writes about robotics being sexist.  Is womens studies have a different type of goal in academic writing than engineering?</p>

<p>To be specific, it is these types of sentences that confuse me on the intent of the academic writing.</p>

<p>""Enter HRP-4C, a new-generation gynoid that was unveiled in the spring of 2009 as a body double of and for (or to replace?) the average human female""  ... why would a journal allow the publication of the unsupported rhetorical question ""or to replace""</p>

<p>""The android wears his maker's unfashionable beige shirt, dark trousers and black windbreaker jacket""... is this professional to call a world famous robotics researcher ""unfashionable"", and why is it necessary?</p>

<p>""...exact body consists of silver and black plastic molded to resemble a Barbarella-like custome, which accentuates her ample breasts and shapely, naturalistic buttocks""... there is no supporting information of how the square, minutely curved metal is purposefully making the visual the author interprets.  But what I dont understand with this is instead of refering to the robot by its name or the paper, the author continues to refer to it as ""robo-Barbarella""</p>

<p>Did I just happen to come across a unique piece of writing, or are there very different styles of writing in academic disciplines?</p>

<p>EDIT:
Yes this is a serious question, and I dont see why this other question, which is very similar but is not asking a specific question (something encouraged on SE) is highly voted <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/3479/unprofessional-to-write-in-a-paper-that-something-is-really-cool?rq=1"">Unprofessional to write (in a paper) that something is &quot;really cool&quot;?</a></p>

17830,"<p>In one of my classes, I had a student who generally understood stuff faster than the others. In tutorials, he would ask a lot of questions, mostly of the kind</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I tried this method instead of what you suggested, is it correct?"" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, this probably sounds like the dream student, but I quickly realized that he was not really after my input, but rather seeking acknowledgement of his superiority (possibly showing off before his friends). </p>

<p>The exchange would often go like this. If what he suggested was correct, fine, I would say ""<em>great!</em>"" and move on. But quite often there would be flaws in his argument, which I would naturally point out. He would always assume that I misunderstood him and when I was (finally) able to show him that his argument did not stand, he would say something like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Oh yeah, that's what I meant to say, but I phrased it wrong""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that this was an math class, so ""phrasing it wrong"" really means ""failing to prove"". When he asked a genuine question and I started providing an explanation, he would cut me off halfway through with something like</p>

17859,"<p>I work at a California community college that has chronically underinvested in computing and networking. The school has been gradually increasing wifi coverage, which now includes all but a few areas of campus.</p>

<p>As a result, you can walk through the cafeteria or the halls of the natural science building and see one student after another watching TV shows on a laptop. Yes, it's conceivable that they have an educational reason for doing so, e.g., maybe they're watching ""I Love Lucy"" in order to research a paper on media stereotypes for their women's studies class. But in reality, I think they just want to watch Spongebob for entertainment.</p>

<p>This causes severe problems, because the network was never designed to be a TV conduit for thousands of students. It apparently was one factor leading to the fact that the entire wifi network went down for the first 6 weeks of this semester.</p>

<p>My school's Acceptable Use Policy forbids various uses such as commercial activity, chat, and playing games, but it does not forbid binge-watching ""Breaking Bad"" over the school's wifi network. I can understand the concern that once the school starts blocking certain web sites, there is a slippery slope leading toward violations of academic freedom. However, it seems farfetched to say that we have to let students access Netflix while logged in to a student account.</p>

<p>Are technological solutions such as bandwidth caps for student accounts a good option? This would seem to sidestep the issue of academic freedom. Spending our way out of the bandwidth deficit does not seem to be an option; not only do we not have the money, but there is every reason to expect that demand would expand to saturate supply.</p>

However, this adventurous mind of mine is risky and can often put my grades in jeopardy. Now, the problem is, there are ""unfortunate"" times where I have to collaborate with other students. It then becomes a serious issue of ego clash, when my classmate wants an easy way out, while I want to be all out conqueror( which I think should be the goal, since I am spending my time at college to learn something new, not to respect and elongate my comfort zone).

However, for various reasons, accessing an article still takes perhaps 30 seconds.

Alternatively, I've considered completing the course work, or pre-studying, during the summer months, then rendering the course work and completing the exams during the regular terms. </p>

<p>In sum: I plan to study law away from the school where I'd like to study logic, so I could go to the school where I'll study logic during the summer terms, and only occasionally during the fall and winter terms. Thinking in or out of the box, what could I do to make this work?</p>

<p>I get the feeling that it is best suited for Scientific work but my MLitt is in History. I have searched my university website about LaTeX and most results come back from the maths department.</p>

<p>I am a part-time research student so my thesis with be approx. 50,000 words. At the moment I am using Libreoffice (I'm a Linux user -Ubuntu distro) to write up each chapter as a separate document which I was going to bring into a master theses document. I am using Mendeley to manage all my footnotes and bibliography.</p>

<p>I'm going to be meeting my supervisor over the next couple of weeks and would like to discuss the matter with him as to if I should use LaTeX. I'm sure how familiarity or usage of LaTeX within the History department will impact on my decision but would also like to prepare my thesis in the best possible way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Edit 10/04/14: After a meeting with my Supervisor it appear that the History department has no preference on software for writing the thesis. Only requirement is that final thesis before defence is printed in ring-bound cover and the (hopefully!) accepted thesis is a hardback bound copy. My last written piece to my supervisor was done in LaTeX, using Texmaker on Ubuntu then exported to pdf, and other than some tweaking we need to do to the citation styling he was quite happy with the output. His advise was to use whatever software I was comfortable with (although he had never heard of LaTeX).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would be grateful for answers from people who have used LaTeX in Humanities area so as to be best prepared for my own decision on whether or not I would like to use it. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Edit 10/03/2014) Just based on some of the answers, especially in
  relation to the learning curve with LaTeX, here is some more info that
  may be useful. Probably about 95% of my thesis will be text but I
  shall also need to insert some images (maps and photos) and will
  probably be entering some tables with stats. As stated above I use
  Mendeley for my refernece manager and have read some blogs where this
  is compatible with LaTeX so I think I would continue to us it if I go
  the LaTeX route.</p>

17968,"<p>I've been offered an academic position, and am now in the fortunate, but unfamiliar position of negotiating the offer.  I've seen a few blogs/comments/posts on this process.  However, I have no real idea how to evaluate the offer that's been made.  Coming from the position of a postdoc, the package seems impressive (given that, as a postdoc, my ""package"" consists of a very modest salary and health benefits).  However, I also realize the importance of maximizing (within reason) my initial offer, as this sets the baseline for, at least, the first few years of my faculty career and could provide support that would prove very important in the initial year or so while I'm trying to obtain grant funding.</p>

<p>In particular, I'm looking for two types of information.  First, what types of startup packages are standard for tenure-track assistant professors of Computer Science at a <em>public</em> RU/VH (i.e. Research) university?  This is just to give me some point of comparison.  Second, what types of changes are reasonable to negotiate?  Can I ask for more summer salary support while still conveying to them my desire to obtain grant funding as quickly as possible?  The offer already includes a reduced teaching load for the first few years --- is it also reasonable to ask for an extra semester off prior to a tenure review?</p>

<p>I understand these are fairly broad questions, but any input or suggestions would be very helpful.  I'm definitely interested in the job; I really liked the department and think it's a great opportunity.  I don't want to alienate anyone by pushing too hard, but at the same time, I want to make sure that I make every reasonable effort to maximize my chances for academic success, which includes maximizing my available resources by negotiating the best startup package I can.  </p>

Its good for me since my life goal is to start a software company myself in future and learning from him can be a game changer. Its bad for me because I'm kinda immature, and staying with him keeps me on a safe side (CEO's nephew).</p>

17988,"<p>My biggest challenge as a PhD student is best summarized by the following from PHD Comics:</p>

<p><sub><strong>""Piled Higher and Deeper"" by Jorge Cham
<a href=""http://www.phdcomics.com"">www.phdcomics.com</a></strong></sub>
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/0eRfS.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>A consequence of working in research is that the end is never in sight - unlike other jobs, <em>there is always more work for you to do</em>. </p>

<p>I am pretty good at making sure to take care of myself, because I know it's important. I can force myself to go for a run, get something to eat, participate in a regular activity that's not related to academia. But I can't turn off the voice in my head that keeps nagging me about the work that's waiting for me back at the office.</p>

<p>This is especially true when there are deadlines and people relying on me to meet them. On top of my research, I have mentees I should be spending more time with, students we won't be able to hire if I don't get my grant-writing act together, collaborators who keep asking when I'm going to write up that work we did together last summer. <em>If I don't do this, nobody else will</em>; it's not like a normal workplace, where your boss can reassign an important task if you are too overloaded to handle it.</p>

<p>So, my question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How do you avoid feeling guilty about all the unfinished (and unfinishable) work in academia?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I am looking for specific, practical techniques based on research and/or personal experience, not suggestions that you just thought of but have never tried.</strong></p>

<p>One technique I've tried with limited success is to make a daily to-do list that is limited to three items, and tell myself that I'm not allowed to feel guilty about not doing things that aren't on the list. It works when I'm not <em>terribly</em> busy... but most of the time it doesn't. </p>

I intend to apply to grad schools(Ph.D) a year after graduation, possibly to the top EE programs in the US (MIT, Berkeley, Stanford...) Despite the fact that ground-breaking/stellar research is virtually impossible to come by for undergraduates in my country, I have sort of gathered some. I have an accepted poster presentation(based on independent research) at the major national conference in my field, and  my present senior year thesis/project may yield three-five papers at IEEE conferences around Africa. I should also be able to get two publications(also independent research) in a continental journal which is popular only among  African Engineers in my field and not much outside.</p>

<p>My degree is a five year bachelors programme interspersed with three internships/co-op experience. One was a summer spent in a local R&amp;D electronics lab/company in which we completed several design projects although all were adaptations/imitation of existing projects to solve problems facing developing societies like ours. Another one was a long internship (~8mths) in the EE division of a world-renowned company with huge presence in my country during which I worked on a major design project which required a lot of technical knowledge and was evaluated. I have also done some remote/virtual research for a foreign, not well-known, research institute in my field and I have completed a technical report (no peer review) of my research(not particularly breath-taking) which they publish in their report series.</p>

<p>My gpa though not near-perfect is on a 'first-class' (we use the british system) and so I am a high-ranking student in my university.

I am also a recipient of several national awards/recognition for academic merit. </p>

18005,"<p>I am interested in understanding if measuring the time it takes for an adult to meet a training milestone is a training metric that is commonly used to assess progress and, if so, what adult learning theories or academics discuss this concept.  </p>

<p>I would suspect that, during training, a group of adults would hit a particular milestone in a given range with some type of frequency distribution that would indicate normal.  I would further suspect that, as we approach either tail, there would be signs of something else going on that is either enhancing training or disabling it in some way and would be cause of alarm, where some type of training intervention would be required for the benefit of the student.</p>

<p>Conversely, is there any reasons why time to milestone is NOT important and should be ignored?  If so, what academic studies are behind that opinion?</p>

<p>EDIT:  I may have thought the topics of this exchange were a bit different, but my problem may generalize to those studying in academia.  Here's the specific question I have:</p>

<p>A debate is going on regarding the number of hours it takes for a pilot candidate to solo.  One side is arguing it simply does not matter, that it indicates nothing as far as the training is concerned or anything about the skills of the pilot after license.  The other side is arguing that it does matter because it indicates the health and progress of the training.  If you captured this solo metric across the US, you'd likely see a distribution of hours from something as low as 15 hours to maybe as high as 30 with the MODE somewhere around 20.  The latter group is arguing that, if your student is approaching 30, or even passes it, something's wrong in the training environment that needs changed.  It is a special cause variation versus normal or common cause variation.  </p>

<p>I was hoping there was some literature that either supported or discounted the need to track time as part of an assessment in education or training.  </p>

<p>Is this on topic for this group?  If not, please let me know so I can post in a more suitable group.  I was going to post in the Aviation exchange, but I don't think that is suitable because I am looking for more of an academic opinion.  Thanks!</p>

  <p>Hello, I am a Molecular Neuroscience major from Heidelberg. I have
  recently graduated from our MSc. program and am currently looking for
  groups in which to pursue my PhD.</p>
  
  <p>I have very versatile experience in neuroscience - ranging from
  molecular biology, microscopy, and genetics in model animals up to
  fMRI, eye tracking, pupillometry, and behavioural tests in humans (for
  more on this please refer to my CV:
  <a href=""http://chymera.eu/docs/cv-acad-gen.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chymera.eu/docs/cv-acad-gen.pdf</a> ). I would like to continue
  using a broad spectrum of methods in my research, and put my scripting
  experience (Python, R, Julia, MATLAB, SPM, FSL) to good use in the
  analysis of complex data sets.</p>
  
  <p>I am very motivated by research into mood disorders and genetics; and
  I would also like to augment my methods spectrum with
  psychopharmacology and NIBS over the following years. I find the
  addition of these methods particularly important because in my opinion
  they present the most solid ways of testing causality in correlations
  between human brain activation and behaviour (as observed via fMRI or
  PET).</p>
  
  <p>I have browsed your list of publications and I found your
  neurogenetics work most motivating. I would like to ask you whether
  you would be able to offer me a PhD position in which I could
  integrate the genetic focus of your group with brain imaging and brain
  stimulation (perhaps to elucidate brain area function or
  psychopharmacological treatment possibilities resolved for
  endophenotypes). I would also be grateful for the opportunity to
  discuss further project ideas with you.</p>

Are there any risks to me submitting a letter, as opposed to her finding a faculty member (who likely would not be in the same field as her interests)? For graduate school applications how much does the position of the person writing a recommendation letter matter, as opposed to his/her academic familiarity with the student? I have already advised her to check with the programs she is applying to in case they have requirements.</p>

<p>Edit: I realize I left this unclear before-- she has two tenured professors willing to write letters. If I agreed to, I would be the third letter. The department is small, so there might not be too many options for an additional letter.</p>

18078,"<p>It's interview season. I've noticed that many of the applicants in this round are already assistant professors at other institutions.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any known number or record on how frequently (let's say, across North America) assistant professors who don't have tenure yet switch institutions?</strong></p>

<p>The market is already incredibly competitive. The academic institution has spent thousands of dollars on hiring a candidate and wants to retain them. If an assistant professor goes to another school and gets hired, then what you might end up with is this cycle of highly-ranking candidates swirling around and leaving empty positions in their wake. Alternatively, one might presume that the hiring system must be inefficient if, in a competitive environment, a university is unable to retain its hires.</p>

<p>This <a href=""http://scientopia.org/blogs/science-professor/2011/01/19/faculty-movers/"">article (and associated comments)</a> for example, illustrates how many faculty have changed institutions for various reasons; I also know personally at least two assistant professors who left their original institution to move to a new one within the first few years of them being hired.</p>

<p>Depending on the answer to this question, I would have a number of follow-ups (Do schools hate it if you apply elsewhere, and would they fire you? How does a department react when a recent hire leaves? Why do people switch? Are applicants often successful? Do people switch more than once?) but I'll start with this first.</p>

18079,"<p>This isn't the best moment to ask the question, since I should be writing an overdue document and presentation. </p>

<p>However, is there any place where a person with fear of writing can work? I am studying for a phd in Europe in STEM. I was always quite good at school and university. I was on schedule with my studies, but the preparation of my master thesis was quite painful and i have the impression than I should have completed it in 60% of the time it took me. After a short experience in the industry in a field close to my own (but for which I didn't have all the skills), I took the opportunity of a phd in my field. Of course before that I had been making interviews for jobs in my field, but never got nothing. Being extremely introvert doesn't help. I already feel embarassed writing my CV, and adding details as hobbies or strength points (actually I ended up skipping those parts). </p>

<p>Now it's been more than 1 year that I'm in this Phd and each writing task is really getting me desperate. Initial proposal, internal reports and presentations provoke me torments for weeks, without getting real work done (neither writing work nor research work) , and ending up crying at home at night in front of a white page (once even at morning at work, but I managed to hide in the bathroom in time). 
I'm lucky that my advisor doesn't put too much pressure on me, but I feel so bad not being able to hand in what I am required, sometimes even after a deadline. The problem is that even if a deadline is reasonable, sometimes I cannot make it because it takes me 2 days to write 1 paragraph (no kidding). Guess how many papers submitted?</p>

<p>Still, I enjoy much more my time here than in the industry. I enjoy academic reading, I have thirst for knowledge and so on, but I see that communication is an essential part for a phd student. So far I am willing to continue the program, but I start doubting that I will ever be confident in writing, then I don't see a future... Any suggestion on how to turn the career path? Also a suggestion on how to overcome fear of writing would be good, but I am afraid I've already read all the good advices here on SE and in many blogs about procrastination, perfectionism, impostor syndrome... </p>

The last time I took an actual math class was AP Calculus in my junior year of high school <em>cough</em> 8 years ago because I did well enough on the AP exam to get credit for everything my major required.</p>

<p>GOAL: Ultimately I plan to pursue a PhD in the Computer Science/Computer Engineering/Electrical Engineering with strong leanings toward AI/Machine Learning/Robotics.  ""Dream School"" is Caltech but any well-respected school with connections to the aerospace industry would be stellar (couldn't resist the pun, sorry.)</p>

<p>EDIT: The program I am going to has a provisional entry option where you take 2 accelerated courses at the beginning which catch you up to speed on programming, data structures and foundational computer science.  The min GPA is 2.75 in any BS/BA program and as long as you get at least a B in both classes they let you continue.  I've worked as a developer/IT person for the last 3 years, my general GRE score was 27 points above their suggested minimum and I took a few random graduate computing courses at SPSU a few years ago and got As in all of them so I think those were contributing factors to my admission.</p>

<p>She emailed the search committee with some requests related to: salary, maternity leave, sabbatical, teaching load, and start date. Her email ended with ""I know that some of these might be easier to grant than others. Let me know what you think."" In response, the institution withdrew the offer, saying that her requests revealed that she wasn't a good fit for a teaching institution.</p>

<p>Many of the comments on the IHE story or blog post are in support of the school, saying such things as:</p>

<ul>
<li>The candidate asked for too much and came across as ""entitled""</li>
<li>The candidate shouldn't have requested a light teaching load initially, when the school in question is a teaching institution</li>
<li>The candidate shouldn't have asked about a pre-tenure sabbatical, which is apparently unheard of at teaching institutions</li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, one comment says this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>indicates how important it is to do your best to understand the culture and needs of the hiring institution, both before and during negotiations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and another that it is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>an example of knowing the difference between negotiating with a research school and with a small teaching school</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's perfectly reasonable to ask for anything</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Definitely ask for all that you need, and let them whittle you down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently, that advice may be more or less applicable depending on the type and culture of the institution. My questions are:</p>

<p>and, more generally, </p>

<p><strong>What can I do pre-offer to get a sense for what the institution's culture is, and what I can reasonably ask for?</strong>  </p>

18190,"<p>I am taking a course in a may-not-be-top-but-still-decent university located in North America. <strong>The course lecturer forces us to pay for an online learning kit from Pearson by adopting all the graded quizzes provided in that learning kit.</strong></p>

<p>That is, if one refuses to pay for the learning kit, he or she will have no access to all the quizzes, which in total constitute 20% of the final grade of that course. Moreover, all the text completion questions are basically exactly the same sentences copied from the eBook. Therefore, if you simply pay for the learning kit (~$50), then you will have a hard time doing the quiz as compared of those who buy the combo including the eBook (~$90).</p>

<p>In summary, if</p>

<ul>
<li>you pay ~$90, during every quiz, simply do <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>, you can always find the exact sentence in the eBook, and hence you can get nearly full marks.</li>
<li>you pay ~$50, you can access the quizzes, but you may have to search somewhere else and spend more time on the quizzes.</li>
<li>If you pay nothing, the 20% marks are gone.</li>
</ul>

<p>I, as a victim who unwillingly paid $90, <strong>find it irritating and unethical</strong>, as I feel this is some sort of a coalition between the lecturer and the publisher. I understand that some lecturers do have recommended textbooks as well, but they are not mandatory! That is, if I can learn that course well by other books, I am free to do that. If I didn't buy the book and hence screwed the course up, that is my own responsibility. I cannot blame any one for that. But this lecturer's deed actually bans the students who do not pay for the learning kit from the quizzes.</p>

  <p>Don’t dabble. Another slightly counter-intuitive one. You might think that, while most of your research work is in area A, the fact that you wrote a couple of papers in area B will be taken as positive evidence of your breadth and intellectual strength. Very wrong. What will actually happen is that your work in area B will be compared to the best people in the world who spend all their time thinking about area B, and you will probably come up wanting. Even worse, it will be taken as evidence that your interests may wander over time — so that, whereas you were hired to be an expert in area A, maybe in a few years you won’t be doing that at all. Kiss of death. Deep down, there is a strongly anti-intellectual strain within academia; you were hired to work in a specialty and that’s what they expect you to do. Once you get tenure, of course, you can do whatever you want; so it’s important that the department be reassured that you don’t want to do anything else.</p>

<p>I've been reading a bit lately about the common core standards initiative and one of the reasons cited for beginning this discussion/initiative was that education standards for students graduating from high school were not meeting the expectations of universities and employers. Yet at the same time others also claim that the expectations of employers and universities have also increased. And then I get the kind of talk from the older generation teachers/professors ""kids these days blah blah blah, nothing like they used to make them blah blah blah, standards were higher back in my day etc.etc."" While I think every generation tends to overestimate the quality of things that they had in their youth, or tend to be more critical of younger generations (and may not be able to fully understand the situation of younger generations) their criticisms must be founded in some reason. I just want to begin to understand where these gaps are coming from and what can be done to solve the problem.</p>

<p>My main questions are :</p>

<p>1) How have math education standards changed over time?</p>

<p>2) How have the expectations in student's mathematical reasoning changed over time?</p>

<p>3) Where is this gap in expectations and standards coming from - rapidly increasing expectations or the stagnation/regression of standards/quality of education?</p>

The reason was that the main lecturer is involved in other duties and for that reason he could not teach one group (there are two groups actually). The thing is that this lecturer has given me all the material: slides, exercises, exams, practices, final project and so on; and he told me explicitly to follow that material.</p>

<p>I have been always a big fan of the freedom of teaching. I mean I believe that if two different lecturers teach course X; then it would be better if they can get two different approaches for the same topics. The Faculty academic coordinator has told me that I must follow the material exactly, because the examinations would be the same for both groups.</p>

<p>I wonder what to do in this situation? I am keen to take published material as a reference for a course, but not to follow all the material exactly from the other lecturer like if I were some sort of ""academic monkey"" (that only mimics what the other has made).

<ul>
<li>The other lecturer and myself be both have the same rank, I mean we both are lecturers, only difference is that the other lecturer has taught the course before and that is why he was appointed coordinator of only that course.</li>
<li>In academic ranks, I got more academic background in CS (two master's already done); in the other hand he is a die hard programmer programmer that has participated in programming contests, but that's it. He has only a bachelor in Information Systems.</li>
<li>The material handed to me is simple, but it gets to my nerves that I must stick completely to it. I mean if a student is well prepared and every teacher follows the syllabic contents; then at the end it does not matter who made the final examinations. The student should be prepare for everything (except that the course is about, for example a Java certification, and I do not teach Java, but C). The point is that is a CS related course, and for that it should relies more in the algorithmic part that on some tricky-twisty programming stuff that tough programmers know.</li>

18376,"<p>there's something I've been curious about regarding the funding of labs in graduate schools. I imagine it's different in different schools, but there's probably a most common scenario.</p>

<p>How is money managed for a lab? My most naive understanding is that the lab mostly gets money from grants. But what happens when a lab runs out of grant money? I assume the school doesn't want a major lab supporting several students and postdocs just folding, so I'm guessing they lend them money.</p>

<p>For example, the are several common facilities at my school that charge the lab when students use them (electron microscopes, etc). I know we're short on money right now, but I've never heard of anyone not being able to use the facilities. I would definitely make sense to me that the school internally lets a lab rack up debt to them with the expectation that it'll be paid back when they get grants in the future.</p>

<p>But how does it work for peoples' paychecks, and non-school payments? I know our lab also has a p-card. Does that mean we may be racking up debt externally?</p>

<p>Now I have a heavier teaching load, preparing course material from scratch week-to-week, and am struggling to cope with my work hours.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With regard to writing books: one of my most distinguished colleagues, Dino Lorenzini, wrote an excellent and rather successful book near the beginning of his career. He now tells anyone who will listen that junior faculty should not write books.

18402,"<p>I am in an engineering field in which conferences are roughly grouped in two types: theoretical conferences with fundamental concepts and related stuff (for instance, algorithms), and application-oriented where people present practical things (e.g. a use-case). These complement each other well, and many researchers attend both.</p>

<p>I am finishing a part of my research which is both fundamental and practical. I have developed a theoretical research result (formulas, algorithms), and I have used it for a practical purpose developing a use-case. Although they are connected, these can be seen as separate work, and two papers can be published out of it.</p>

<p>My problem is that the two conferences of my preference are scheduled in an unfortunate sequence: the practical conference comes three months before the theoretical, and its deadline for submission is also roughly three months earlier.</p>

<p>It means that if I write the practical paper which uses the theoretical knowledge before the one that introduces it and describes it, I cannot refer to the (unpublished) theory, and the subsequent theoretical paper may lose its value.

It's like writing a paper about results of testing a medication, before the medication was introduced.</p>

18410,"<p>So a TA came to me asking for advice. He gave wrong information in office hours leading a student to a wrong answer. </p>

<p>The TA showed the student how to solve the problem via the wrong statistical test - the assumptions for the statistical test he used do not hold in this case. The answer generated from this test yields a test statistic that doesn't make any sense when you think about it's meaning. Kind of like if you were asked to ""find the length of the fence that encloses ..."" and your method produced the answer of -50 meters. The TA provided the student with step by step instructions, but did not do any of the numerical calculations. Had he done those calculations he would almost certainly have caught his mistake.</p>

<p>The student complains that she should not be punished because her TA made a mistake. TAs can change HW grades, if they have good reason to do so, and this TA wants to correct his mistake by rewarding the student the points on the problem. I told the TA that I would get back to him as I don't want to give my advice in haste. I think I want to say something like this. </p>

<p>to the TA: ""Thank you for asking for my advice in this situation; it is indeed a difficult position to be in. However, this situation concerns me, not because you gave wrong info or bad advice, as we all occasionally make mistakes, but because you seem to have told a student the method for answering the question. While it's OK for students to get help from their TAs, it should only be by reviewing concepts and asking them 'leading questions' that nudge them in the right direction. Note I am not saying that what you did is objectively wrong, as I should have been more clear in my instructions at the beginning of the course, but in the future telling students how to do a problem, in my opinion, is unfair to the students who can't make your office hours.""</p>

<p>to the student: ""Your TA contacted me recently about changing your HW grade. While I sympathize with your situation, and understand that it is very frustrating to receive bad advice/information from your TA, it is ultimately your responsibility to make sure your solution is reasonable, and therefore I can not give you full credit on this problem. Ultimately the majority of the points you lost were not for using this incorrect method (the TAs error), it was for not interpreting your answer and realizing it made no sense. As stated on the first day of class and in the syllabus I require all students to interpret their answers to make sure they make sense. Please come see me if you would like advice on how to check your answers as this is a very important skill in all scientific disciplines and in life in general. TAs, solutions manuals, and even professors make mistakes. Never trust something just because it was told to you by someone with more authority.""</p>

<p>I guess if the everything else was the same between the two then the answer is obvious, which is to go for the funded one. But the problem in my case is this: 
In the fully funded case I have been offered a place in a research group I have no primary interest in (and no previous knowledge of) and something which I would not have definitely chosen if I was given a choice. So in sum, although it comes with a lot of money, the work is something I'm unsure if I will enjoy.</p>

<p>In the second case, there is no aid. The tuition fee + living is something which is not completely unaffordable for, I hope to manage those with loans and some family money. Aside that, I feel there is a lot of flexibility (or at least some flexibility), as I can choose my domain of work and my advisor once I have enrolled, and maybe been through a semester. Also the coursework here is a lot more closer to my preferred area of research. </p>

18522,"<p>I apologize for the length of this post but I feel it is necessary to accurately convey the severity of the situation. I greatly appreciate those who take the time to offer advice.</p>

<p>I am a prospective PhD student in a major research institution and am writing on behalf of numerous students frustrated with our department's qualifying exam (QE). Things have been getting progressively worse over the past few years such that my fellow students have decided to petitioned our department(dept.) head for a procedural change. Unfortunately, several students refused to sign the petition for fear of malicious treatment by the faculty. The response to our petition from the dept. head and other faculty was unfavorable to the point that we are considering filing a formal complaint with the University. I would like to gauge the objective opinions of unbiased parties as to whether our reasons for complaint are justifiable.</p>

<p>I will describe the QE procedure and summarize our complaints below:</p>

<p>The formal reasoning given by our dept. for having a qualifying exam is ""To determine whether the student has the knowledge, skills, and ability to conduct independent thinking and creative research."" The QE is composed of 4 consecutive one hour written examinations, a research assessment paper on a pre-selected journal article specific to our research field, and an oral examination where we present the contents of our research assessment paper and then answer questions from 3 faculty members until they are satisfied. Students may retake any sections which they fail the following year. If after the second attempt, all parts have not been passed, the student must petition for a third attempt. If the petition is not accepted, the student must defect to the master's program. If that student already has a M.S. from the department (as is my case) then the student is forced to leave the program and 3 years of tuition is wasted. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Students are not allowed to see their graded exams or know their exam score. This privilege was removed without warning two years ago despite being present in our universities' student bill of rights. We are notified via letter of pass/fail status only. Also, no statistics are provided regarding the range of scores, number of students who passed, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The dept. never reveals what score constitutes passing or failing. We have heard via word of mouth from certain faculty who sympathize with out situation, that passing can range from 30% to 80% depending on the exam category and changes from year to year. This, however, is not administrable evidence and would most likely be denied by the faculty who told us if ever questioned. </p></li>
<li><p>Exam content consistently strays outside the provided list of topics. The provided topic list appears to be lazily assembled by copy/pasting from course syllabi. The 4 exams are technically supposed to be covered by the 3 courses which the department requires all graduate students to take (they do not offer a graduate class covering the fourth topic). However, questioned are routinely posed from material covered in non-required classes, some of which are only offered every few years. </p></li>
<li><p>Exams are written by professors who's field of research is entirely unrelated to the exam topic and/or professors who have never taught the class which the exam covers. This leads to major inconsistencies in the materials covered and puts students who took the class from a different professor at a disadvantage  Again, the dept. refuses to reveal who writes the exams. However, we generally figure it out in hindsight from off-the-record discussions.</p></li>
<li><p>The passing rate of these exams is very low. Less than 20% of students pass all exams their first attempt. Again, we cannot prove it, but it is suspected that the decision to pass a student is biased based on whether it is the students second attempt. Also, many students who get A's in the covered classes are failing these exams. </p></li>
<li><p>After our meeting with the dept. head regarding our petition, it was announced that the subjective third attempt to pass all sections was no longer going to be allowed. This is unfair as many students have required this third attempt in the past. Also, students taking these exams for the second time (which were in February), did so under the impression that, based on past history, they would get a third attempt if needed. This new policy will effectively force them to leave without a degree. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>This list of complaints could go on for pages but I will leave it at that. I understand that a PhD QE should not be easy; however, in your opinion, are our frustrations warranted? I welcome both advice and constructive criticism. Also, please share if you have any similar experiences!</p>

18532,"<p>Main Issue:  What credit should be given (and how should it be given) to the alma mater in publicizing old work?</p>

<p>Background: I entered and left a Ph.D. program in another millenium.  During this time
I produced some results, one group of which was to become my dissertation.  (At one point, my advisor said the equivalent of ""you have enough to graduate; write it up"".)  However, all that I did distribute during my time as a graduate student was a couple of preprints, one of which later got cited in work of others.  I did not finish the dissertation and did not get the degree (although I did get to attend commencement and walk across the stage).  If it matters, during the time I produced results I got one TA (teaching) grant, and no other funding.</p>

<p>I am considering self-publishing material related to the work I did in grad school.
I have already given presentations on some of the work;  I now plan to submit to ArXiv some of my work done while I was in graduate school; later I may follow up with results based
on this work. </p>

<p>Question 1.  What kind of issues might I encounter in doing so?  Would the University have some recourse to discourage me?</p>

<p>Question 2.  If there are no intellectual property issues involved, what is an acceptable format?  (I was thinking: write a wrapper giving a brief history and introduction, insert my preprint verbatim, and close with acknowledgments and some follow up.  The preprint I distributed does not contain my dissertation, but is a key piece of it.  What would the
acknowledgment section look like?)</p>

<p>Question 3.  If I decide I also want to go back and finish
my degree at that program, (ideally by finishing the remaining requirement of submitting
the finished and approved dissertation, however unlikely that may be), would doing this
self-publishing be contraindicated?  If so, why?</p>

<p>Additionaly, when I designed the assignment, I did not fully appreciate how difficult it would be for the students and how difficult it was going to be to grade.

18696,"<p>I'm not sure if this question is okay to post here (I am only an undergrad), so please feel free to close/migrate if necessary. I won't be offended.</p>

<p>I am an undergraduate taking an undergraduate CS class right now. I feel the class is being taught like a graduate-level course, but we are being tested like undergraduates. I say this because I have taken graduate-level STEM classes in the past, and I think my professor is teaching the material as if we were graduate students.</p>

<p>The homework in this class emphasizes theoretical understanding and proof writing. When the midterm was upon us, we were given no practice problems to prepare for the test. There were no practice midterms either. Going into the midterm, I figured, well, the professor will probably test us on our understanding of the material. However, the midterm tested for speed and accuracy. There were several short answer questions that had little to do with the kind of understanding of the material we developed from the homework. In fact, there were questions for which we haven't yet had homework. I think he tried to make the test ""easy,"" which totally threw me off.</p>

<p>I did very poorly on my midterm, and now I am trying to figure out whether I can judge what to expect in a graduate-level class vs. an undergraduate-level class so I may avoid such poor exam performance in the future. I have come up with the following qualities to expect from a graduate-level STEM class vs. an undergraduate-level STEM class.</p>

<p><strong>Graduate-level STEM Class</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Emphasis on depth of understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>Abstract material can sometimes be presented ad hoc: Less emphasis on linear presentation of material.</p></li>
<li><p>Theoretical presentation of material. Typically, we look at axioms/rules whenever we are presented new notation. We then derive everything from these axioms/rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Often the material covered has so much depth that we are expected to have minimal breadth of understanding; We are expected to take what we've learned and focus on a particular are in great depth.</p></li>
<li><p>Exams, projects, and papers test understanding of the material, not the speed in which we can solve arbitrary problems.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Undergraduate-level STEM Class</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Emphasis on breadth of knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>Material is presented in a linear fashion, often starting with some concrete examples and building from there.</p></li>
<li><p>There is often so much ground to cover that we are taught through rote memorization. We solve problems excessively.</p></li>
<li><p>Exams test for speed and accuracy of exact solutions to several problems. One often succeeds in such a class by performing many practice problems.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My questions are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is this accurate? If not, why, and what kinds of differences can I expect between graduate vs. undergraduate-level courses?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there other/better ways to find correlations between teaching and testing styles? How can I know I am prepared for an exam given a professor's teaching style (rote memorization vs. emphasis on derivations, etc.)?</p></li>

18702,"<p>I am set on going to graduate school in computational science, specifically computational molecular biology and biochemistry. I am from a CS/Math background however and intend on applying to computational science + engineering programs but with research focused on biological applications (for example, someone like the famous Vijay Pande would be an advisor I would love to work with). So my question is: Is it bad to do research with as many as three or four different professors at once?</p>

<p>I took 8-9 courses (double the normal amount) in each of my first three semesters, to get them out of the way, and also started doing research with one professor in my third semester. This semester (4th), and for all future semesters, I will be taking only 3-4 classes each one, mostly graduate-level courses (taking 4 right now probably 3 in all later ones). Because I have experience taking 2-3x the workload (a lot of grad classes are actually less work), I spend only a couple hours a week on my courses because I've learnt to be extremely efficient. Thus, the majority of my time is spent on research (I sleep about 7 hours a day, so I'm spending around 9 hours a day on research right now with ~3 hours in class, 1 hour eating, and 4 hours free time, on week days, and even more free time on weekends). I am currently doing research with two different professors, which is not uncommon at my university. One is in computational biophysics and one is in computational linear algebra. There is also a very interesting professor in statistical genomics that I'd like to get involved with next semester, as well as a professor in mathematics who I'd like to do research with. I view my free time as pretty useless to be honest, I'd rather be doing research, but with the 9 hours a day I already spend I'm finishing as much as there is to do until the next day I meet with my advisors and figure out the next steps. So is it bad if I get myself involved in even more research projects? My work with the two current professors will result in publications soon, and the work with the two other professors I'm interested in working with would likely result in publication considering the fact that most other students who work with those professors do end up publishing a paper. All are relevant to my area (because of its inherently interdisciplinary nature) but would grad schools look at me and see someone who is crazy and not committed, even if I do achieve enough depth in all of the four fields to publish a quality paper? I am also doing research in the summer with the same professors and next summer also. I really love to do research and I don't want to let any of these opportunities go but at the same time graduate school is my ultimate goal so if it means I should only keep doing research with two professors then I will do that. Because I don't want the schools to think they will accept me and then I won't commit to my advisor and I will go gallivanting off somewhere else. I am not flighty like that but I can see why doing so many projects might imply that.</p>

18725,"<p>Most colleges and universities in the US base their admissions on high school grades plus a standardized test (SAT or ACT). To decide whether a particular piece of data X is a good admissions criterion, people seem to focus on how well X correlates with college grades. (This may be freshman grades or total college GPA. Some people think  success in getting a degree would be more appropriate. For the purposes of this question, I don't think these distinctions are relevant.)</p>

<p>Isn't this correlation a completely incorrect way of evaluating X as a tool for admissions?</p>

<p>It seems like an apples-to-oranges comparison. A student who has low X is admitted to a nonselective school, where standards are low and they compete with other low-X students. Grades at this school measure how well they did based on the low standards prevailing there. Students who have high X are admitted to a selective school. A ""B"" grade at Berkeley is not the same as a ""B"" grade at Cal State Dominguez Hills. A high-X student goes to Berkeley and gets a ""B"" in calculus. A low-X student goes to CSDH and gets a ""B"" in calculus. This shows up in the statistics as a lack of correlation between X and grades, since the students differed in X but got the same grade. But isn't that misleading, since the grades mean different things at the two schools?</p>

18779,"<p>Last term, I collected some important projects from about 200 students. When I returned all of the work the next week, one student claimed that they had submitted their work, but never received it back. A misplaced project was highly unlikely, as they were individually bound in a uniform, bright cover and carried in sealed bags, so I assigned the student a 0. Still, I would like to have proof of “no submit”, especially as my supervisor occasionally wants an explanation for failing grades. But not having something is not proof of never submitting. What method can I use in the future to prove that a student did not submit their work?</p>

18846,"<p>Take, for example, that a student is nearing the end of their thesis project.</p>

<p>The supervisor has an idea for a new method that can help to verify the results of part of the project. He does not think much of the significance of the idea at the time, [writes up a document outlining the procedure] and passes it to the student to implement.</p>

<p>A week later, a problem arises. The supervisor questions whether the idea was in fact more significant than he originally thought - i.e. could form a paper on its own, and has realised that answering the students questions on the specifics of how to implement the said method would take up more time/effort then just doing it themselves.</p>

<p>So, how would the supervisor go about retracting the new project from the student? From the student's point of view, they would have a strong motivation to try and implement the idea that has been brought to their attention since it is directly relevant to their thesis work. Yet the supervisor does not want to be hassled by the student on learning the specifics (that would form the content of the paper), and does not want the student to claim partial ownership of the idea. The student has not yet produced any results using the method that has been passed to them.</p>

<p>The issues that I see are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the supervisor tells the student to relax and think about something else instead, they probably would not listen</li>
<li>If the supervisor works independently from the student to produce the paper (figures, text, observing trends), then the student could still claim that they were involved (?) since they would have probably started working on it too</li>

18930,"<p>Here is some context, I am currently a graduate student in education but I come from an art background. Needless to say, writing papers is not something I've done on a regular basis since high school. </p>

<p>Although I've gotten good grades on the two previous ones I wrote, I suspect they drained me a lot more than they should have had. I tend to be able to see the contradictions in everything, which I find is very helpful (as well as annoying) in my life in general but it makes writing position papers a living hell. I always feel like I am presented with a question that can not be answered and that I am forced to give a definite answer to it. </p>

<p>An example of question from a previous paper would be: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learner-centered approaches should replace teacher-centered approaches</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once I find an angle on how to go about it while feeling reasonably comfortable, things flow and it's not a problem but I always have this nagging doubt that it's not good because half the time I end up not really answering the question but dismissing it because nothing is this black or white. I tend to want to run everything by the teacher to get feedback because I'm never sure what we are really expected to do. I would fare much better if the question was in the likes of: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What should one take into account when choosing between teacher-centered
  approaches and learner-centered approaches?</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I have opinions but I feel like they're not applicable in all scenarios.
Sometimes I feel like those papers are only used to see how well we can write, how well you can form an argument and be convincing but I see little value in convincing just for sake of it. How can I get out of this rut?</p>

<p>The salary offered is 50% of the German TV-L E13 salary, which I think is acceptable by academic standards. However, all other offers which I have received are 65% of TV-L E13, though all of these other groups pursue topics which to me are slightly less interesting. To give you a bit of background, 50% has been the standard for a long time, but since a couple of years ago most groups in my field are deciding to award their PhD employees 65%.</p>

<p>I am very motivated by my particular interests, and had the salary been equal for all offers I would have taken this one without question. Sadly, the situation being as it is, I am quite split. Additionally, the professor made it quite clear that I would also have to get involved in teaching (not all other groups were as forward about this) - which I do not mind in the slightest, but which I think would give cause for extra consideration when calculating a salary. Regarding the professor's interest, he seemed very keen to have me on board, but also very confident I would take his offer. </p>

18969,"<p>I am currently interviewing for tenure-track faculty positions at a number of top departments in my field.  Despite getting some very positive feedback about my interviews, I have not yet received any offers.  So far I have tried to avoid any ""game playing,"" being very explicit with each department about where and when I am interviewing.  Likewise, in follow-up discussions with hosts, I have been careful not to state any strong preferences for one school or another, mentioning that I still have additional places to visit (seems only fair!).  I am starting to wonder, however, whether this approach was a mistake, especially given that others in my field are already receiving offers.</p>

<p>The question is, how should I proceed from here?  Part of the issue is that I do not fully understand how and when offers are made, which leads to several questions:</p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> <em>How often are offers made before the end of the interview period (i.e., before all candidates have been interviewed)?</em></p>

<p>I know it happens, of course, but how frequently?  (E.g., as a percentage of all offers made by the department over a 10-year period.)  A related question is</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> <em>If a candidate expresses that a school is her top choice, does it make any difference to the hiring committee?</em></p>

<p>In fact, can expressing this kind of preference actually <em>hurt</em> a candidate's chances?  E.g., perhaps it makes this candidate look like a ""sure thing,"" which frees the department to first make an offer to another, ""higher-risk"" candidate.  In general, when is a good time to express such a preference?  Finally,</p>

<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> <em>To what extent do different departments talk to each-other?</em></p>

<p>For instance, is there any mechanism in place to prevent candidates from ""falling through the cracks?""  E.g., one can easily imagine a situation in which lower-ranked schools don't make a candidate an offer because they expect she will get an offer from a higher-ranked school; subsequently, the higher-ranked schools make her no offer and she is left without a job.  Likewise, if I express a preference for school X before visiting school Y, do I risk pissing off my hosts at Y?</p>

<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> <em>Do I just need to relax?</em></p>

<p>I am almost tempted to write an email CC'ing all the department chairs, providing a complete ordering of my preferences... they can duke it out from there.  (Or simply tell me that <strong><em>none</em></strong> of them want to hire me!)  In general, the whole game-theoretic aspect of this thing makes me a bit queasy.  Wish some brilliant economist would design a mechanism that is fair for both departments and candidates alike.  Right now, it definitely feels like a buyer's market.</p>

<p>Some problems that I have seen which make identifying research gaps difficult:</p>

<ul>
<li>The best problems are already identified or solved by other people.</li>
<li>Authors of publications sometimes avoid being overly critical of their own work, and try to phrase their publication so as to make it seem definitive, and avoid admitting that they failed to explain a phenomenon.</li>
<li>Some scientists are wary of being scooped, and avoid mentioning what they see as future projects in the discussion section.</li>
<li>Due to publish or perish culture, there is pressure to split research efforts into minimal chunks - such chunks may seem like they are steps along the way to a solution, but in reality, trying to work on the apparent next step is risky because the author is likely to scoop you.</li>
<li>High-profile journals such as <em>Nature</em>, <em>Science</em> or <em>PNAS</em> probably prefer papers which answer many questions, rather than presenting many uninvestigated open ends.</li>
<li>Lesser journals may have publications that have only solved part of a problem, but those may be buried under a sea of uninteresting publications. (also the lesser journals are much more numerous and harder to get abreast of)</li>

19064,"<p><strong>The situation</strong></p>

<p>I'm a PhD student and serve as an assistant to several courses. Now, the students were complaining that some rules of our course are not good for them - there are some restriction what has to be achieved in order to participate in the final exam, e.g.</p>

<ol>
<li>they need a certain amount of credits in their homework,</li>
<li>everybody who has failed that course in the years before, have the get the credits for their homework again.</li>
</ol>

<p>You have freedom in chosing the threshold, but the rules are written in the examination regulations (I'm also a member of the that examination committee) that is not the problem. </p>

<p>There are some professors in my department who don't follow that rules; or (even) worse come up with some funny new rules contradicting the rules (like (you don't have to read this to answer the question)  <em>If you have 50% of the credits until the third to last week of the semester, you are able to participate in the final exam. If you pass, you pass. If you fail, you are only allowed to participate in the repetition of the final exam if you have 50% of your credits in the last week of the semester</em>).</p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>

<p>Apart from them violating the rules, the problem is now that students come to my course and say: ""Hey, professor XX did not have the rules last year. Why do you have them? That is so unfair! And you can have it, too! Because, nobody complained last year! Cmon, we will not tell anyone!"".</p>

<p>As soon as I hear something like that, I complain. The problem is then: No student would tell someone things like that (exept in the mentioned case when they try to convince me to do it that way, too); the professors are sometimes not informed, but also sometimes aware of that und don't write anything on their course homepage. So nobody can find out. If you find out (probably at the end of the semester), it is too late and if you want to declare that course as not following the rules, you are only damaging the students of that course. </p>

<p>I was talking to the responsible persons in my department; they see the problem, but they don't want to have fights within the department and they don't to establish automatic announcements from the professors what the rules for their course are. </p>

<p><strong>The question</strong></p>

<p>What can I do against it? The atmosphere in my course was very bad because of that. I could go to the head of the faculty or the university who will end all that, but then I fair to be an abandoned person in my department. Also, I want not to damage students and declare their passed exams as illegal.</p>

I am one of top 5% students of theirs and I published three papers with them.</p>

<p>I feel like I am stuck between the hammer and the rock here. My question is <strong>what is the best tactic I can follow at this stage?</strong> Cut down the number of programs I apply for?

<p>Long story short, I have been applying to quite a few bioinformatics PhD programs in the US and been rejected from most of them.

19193,"<p>During my high school career, I had the unique opportunity to take multiple mathematics courses at my local university, and after graduating, I took two graduate level math courses: Measure theory, and a class on topological manifolds. This was a great experience, but it has left me in a shifty situation.</p>

<p>I asked the department head if I could be admitted into the program since I took a full time course load receiving a B+ and A respectively, but it was denied due to the fact that I did not have a bachelors. The only option given to me at this university would be to enroll in the undergraduate program and take graduate courses.</p>

<p>I would be open to that idea, but it has multiple pitfalls. First of all, I am not guaranteed any research opportunities, which view as highly restrictive on my growth as a mathematician. In addition, I am not guaranteed funding opportunities like I would be in the graduate school. This in combination with the fact that I would have to take 50% more credit hours of course work would mean I would end up having to take out more loans than I would like. This is all very disappointing for me.</p>

<p>Instead of enrolling in courses again, this semester I began independent study in algebra and differential topology using Aluffi's and Lee's book respectively on the subjects. In addition, I have been exposing myself to more theoretical physics, such as Yang-Mills theories and Supersymmetry. Because these subjects are capturing my interest as well, it seems natural that I take my studies towards Algebraic Geometry and String Theories. I really want to get involved with a program to help enable me with my studies, but I do not think an undergraduate program would be adequate. For those of you who are still reading, how can I work towards getting into a program which would enable my studies an empower me with supervised research?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I did not think my undergraduate work would to be too relevant, since most of it was not rigorous; that is, calculation based. I took undergraduate courses in ODE's, PDE's, probability theory, analysis, mulitvariable calculus, and linear algebra. Unfortunately, I did not do well in the ODE, calculus, and linear algebra courses because they were during the summer, and I had not yet acclimated to the required amount of work. In this specific program, my course work is nearly equivalent to a bachelors degree, sans single variable calculus and a class in discrete math.</p>

19199,"<p>Obviously a Principal Investigator (PI) has many responsibilities toward his or her subordinates, including mentoring them, helping to direct their research, providing funding, and resolving difficulties.</p>

<p>But, in practice, it is often possible for a PI to avoid many of these responsibilities and ""get away with it"". By this I mean that failing to address these responsibilities has little effect on the PI's own career.</p>

<p>For example, it is often understood that a PI should have some input when PhD students are writing manuscripts. A PI with a large lab may have a policy of leaving students to fend for themselves in this regard. With some intelligent selection at the hiring stage, this PI may ensure that most of his or her students are already capable of writing papers with no assistance. The few that slip through will fail to have a productive PhD, but this will not directly impact the PIs career all that much.</p>

<p>Similarly, a PI may be unable to come up with good research ideas, but this can be compensated for by actively seeking out graduate students who do have good ideas. Since it is rare to explicitly state in science who had the idea for a project, the PIs CV will still look good thanks to the papers the students end up publishing.</p>

<p>However, an example of an obligation is applying for grants. If a PI is ineffective at securing grants, it is very unlikely that their career will not suffer. Students and junior lab personnel simply don't have the knowledge or experience needed to put together a good application, and while post-docs can secure their own funding, the majority of funds in a typical lab is brought in by the PI. If the PI decides to not bother himself with obtaining funding, the lab will become financially hamstrung, research will suffer, and even to a casual outside observer it will be obvious that the scientific output of the research group is appreciably constrained.</p>

<p>My question is, which responsibilities cannot be avoided by a PI without necessarily producing severe negative consequences? If after a cursory examination, a PI's career seems to be going well, which responsibilities can we be certain have not been neglected?</p>

19235,"<p>Because of the longish nature of the question - here is a TL;DR, and details will be provided below:</p>

<p>I have a full-time job, and am a part-time PhD student who is experiencing tremendous struggles throughout the first year, compared to my previous schooling which was extremely easy. I want to know if I'm psyching myself out / over-thinking things, or if I'm being rational or not, given all the circumstances.</p>

<hr>

<p>My academic career began with a degree in Computer Science. During my studies, I realized that I liked Mathematics significantly more. Because I was so close to completing the CS degree, I completed it (w/ 3.1 GPA overall, 3.5 Math - due to other classes), but I took as many side courses in Mathematics as I could. The Math classes that I did take extra - I excelled at. I even began to buy more Mathematics textbooks and study them on my own, learning more than I was required to in all other topics. Eventually, I had the thought to do graduate study in Mathematics, and soon enough, it seemed like I wouldn't be happy unless I did so. A couple of my professors thought it was a great idea, considering how well I did in their classes, and suggested going for a PhD, part-time as I have a full-time job, in the same school. They wrote me stellar recommendation letters and I got in without any issues, whatsoever (unfunded, but that was not a concern to me).</p>

<p>I am nearing the end of my first year in the program, and it has been an unbelievable struggle. In my first semester, I had a family/personal emergency that caused me to skip four weeks of classes. I fell so far behind that I had to withdraw from my classes for that semester. Despite how embarrassed I was, my professors told me it was okay and that things happen, and that they still had complete faith in me. Now it's the second semester, and in the class that I'm in, currently (the classes I were in are fall-only, so I couldn't hop back into them), the professor is not that great. He did not provide a syllabus or have any idea of what the next lecture is; rather he just ""goes with the flow."" I tend to require a more ""structured"" situation. I have a feeling that the reason I am currently struggling to keep up in this class is not due to ability necessarily, but I have a feeling due to rigor. I have always approached Math via my intuition. Approaching things rigorously, however, is proving to be very challenging. I am able to follow the logical path of a proof no problem and test it's validity, but following textbooks that are just statement of proof after proof is extremely unintuitive and hard to learn; as the proofs seem to be pulled out of thin air.</p>

<p>When sitting in lectures, I am able to follow what my professors usually are talking about, and participate, but when it comes to studying or applying it that's when I struggle. Self-study takes so long and is very arduous and as I'm not used to it; I get extremely distracted. Compounded with this, is that I want to discuss this with others, but I find it almost impossible to face my professors that recommended me, anymore. I haven't spoken to them since the winter due to shame. They had so much faith and confidence in me (and probably still do), but I feel that as a PhD I should do better, but I'm not. My performance is shocking and appalling to me, considering what I was used to doing. Talking to my adviser, is out of the question as well, as when I discussed my last-semester withdrawal situation with him, he made a loose implication that ""he wasn't necessarily sure he would've admitted me, in hindsight,"" and he wondered aloud who was the one that did admit me. </p>

<p>I am still in a position where I feel that I would not be happy unless pursuing graduate study in mathematics, as I want to learn this subject inside and out, be surrounded by a community that I find interesting and exciting, and researching and publishing new ideas. I just have no idea if my struggle is either completely normal, if I'm horribly under-qualified, or if I am just psyching myself out. Am I thinking rationally about this - or am I grossly overreacting?</p>

19248,"<p>I am an undergraduate at a large public research university in the US, finishing my second year. I have done some theorycrafting around my graduation course requirements, and I have realized that it is possible, with some work (and generous CLEP testing), to graduate with a double major, Math BS + Physics BA, by next May. I would be meeting the bare-minimum requirements for both majors (in particular, for math, I will have only taken the 4-semester calculus series, lin. algebra, and the 2-semester abstract algebra series; plus some extraneous ones e.g. game theory).</p>

<p>If I were to stay the extra year, I would comfortably qualify for a double Math BS + Physics BS, and I would have 3-4 more math classes under my belt (perhaps the 2-semester topology series, graph theory, advanced abstract algebra, real analysis, etc). (edit: this option, Physics BS rather than BA, stresses a more thorough physics courseload; 15 hours of upper level physics classes are required for BS over BA)</p>

<p>edit after several answers: Another 4-year option is to get Physics BA + Math BS, leaving my course load open to taking 3-4 math classes per semester. This, hypothetically, could put my post-lin-algebra courses at 2 sem. abstract algebra, 2 sem. topology, 2 sem. intro analysis, graduate level courses of the above, intro complex analysis, intro graph theory, etc</p>

<p>My intent, if I were to graduate next year, is probably to take a year off from academics, and then apply for graduate/PhD programs in math.</p>

Thank you</p>

<p>Additional Information</p>

<p>I think there are always exceptions to the general rule of writing theses. That's, some may not have a supervisor, guidelines, etc. This is another story. 
Concerning definitions of terms, they can be presented as a glossary or discussed in a separate section. Where this section should be put is my question. I have seen theses having it in the introduction while others in literature review chapter discussing each term in detail.</p>

19282,"<p>Despite receiving a job (post-doc) offer in January <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/q/16862/21"">I have kept applying to other positions (post-doc and teaching track jobs)</a>. This was <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/a/16869/21"">not a bad idea in retrospect, I suppose</a></p>

<p>This post doc job offer I received is in Europe (<strong>France</strong>) and required me to apply for a ""long stay visa"". I am currently a visiting faculty in a well known mid-western university in the USA. My citizenship is ""Indian"".</p>

<p>I did apply for a long stay visa and have not received it yet. In the mean time I have received a job offer for one teaching track (non-tenure but ""long term"" contract) job at my current university.</p>

<p>I have not been offered tenure track jobs anywhere since I have a backlog of publications right now.</p>

<h2>Here is the problem:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>My post doc job starts in 3 weeks time and I haven't received my visa yet. I have to make other arrangements too (air tickets, housing in Europe, other stuff for a trans-continental move).</p></li>
<li><p>I have been given 3 weeks to decide and confirm my availability for the teaching track job.</p></li>
<li><p>I prefer the post doc since it is a more appealing challenge. The downside is I have to exit the USA if I get my visa and go to Europe.</p></li>
<li><p>The teaching track job offers me stability, a full time employment and a salary that is difficult to beat in the post doc job and in my home country of India.  The downside is that teaching track lecturers are treated as ""mules"" in the USA and are burdened with courses that ""tenure track"" do not want. This would mean that any research aspirations I have go down the drain since I won't be afforded time to do research.</p></li>
<li><p>For me as a foreigner, it is not just working on my ""passion"" but also getting a lucrative position with which to support my family. I have to strike a balance between working on my passion and living in a developed country with a good salary.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am confused as to what to do. </p>

<h2>Here are options that occur to me (deferment of either position is not a possibility):</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Wait for 3 weeks and irrespective of the visa decision, take a risk and say ""no"" to the teaching track job and take my chances with the European visa and miss an opportunity to have a full time job in the USA.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait for the next 3 weeks, if EU visa is not delivered to my house, just tell the lab that I cannot wait any longer since I have to make a career decision and take the teaching track job and miss a fantastic research opportunity for a great salary but a job that could very easily become flavorless.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Some more detail that I need to factor in:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I love to teach and have received some teaching awards for graduate and undergraduate courses I have taught as a visiting faculty.</p></li>
<li><p>However, I love research as well and understand that teaching and research are symbiotic activities and that the EU postdoc (which is a research position) allows me to do research and develop as a better teacher.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>My question:</h2>

<p>I am <strong>not</strong> asking this forum to make my decision for me; I just want to know how to weight this situation rationally and try and cut my losses if things go to pot. What are some of the decision making paradigms that one would use in such a situation?</p>

<p>If there are other details that may not have occured to me, would prove useful, do let me know via a comment below and I will try to include them.</p>

<h2>Amendments to question:</h2>

<p><em>""what is the likelihood that the visa will appear in the next three weeks, and what methods do you have to estimate this likelihood?""</em></p>

<p>The consulate tells me that it takes between 2 weeks and 2 months for a decision on ""long stay visa"" to be made. It is week 3 of my wait.</p>

<p>There would appear to be no way of estimating the likelihood other than tracking the status on a status page. All it says right now is: ""Your application is under consideration"". Contacting the consulate yielded the same answer.</p>

19295,"<p>I'm teaching an online lab (to accompany an in-person course) to undergrads in their 3rd or 4th year of an engineering curriculum this semester. The aim of the lab is <em>not</em> to teach them any particular technical skills. It's only meant to supplement the <em>content</em> of the course by exposing them to some more advanced concepts in a hands-on way. The lab itself is the means, not the goal.</p>

<p>So beyond a single ""orientation"" lab, they don't get a whole lot of training in debugging things that go wrong in the lab, and I don't expect them to become advanced users of the lab infrastructure. They're encouraged to post questions on a course forum if they have trouble running a lab exercise, and I answer their questions there.</p>

<p>Having said that, some students post questions that would be closed immediately on a Stack Exchange site for lack of detail, and for good reason. Questions like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can't log in to the website, please help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I run the experiment, it gives me an error. Can somebody help me???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can't see the results of the experiment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>with no further details. These are perfectly reasonable things to ask about, but the student hasn't even attempted to give me any details as to what went wrong. In the ""real world,"" people that ask questions like this won't usually get help.</p>

<p>Since I operate the computing infrastructure for the lab, I can actually find out the specifics of what happened by checking the student's username against the server logs. So I can give them an answer even if they ask a really incomplete question (e.g., I can check the server logs and see that their experiment failed because they mistyped a command).</p>

<p>But I'm not sure if I should answer their questions (because I can, and I want to encourage them to ask questions if they have trouble), or if I should try to train them to ask better questions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On the one hand: it seems like I am doing them a disservice by not teaching them how to ask for help properly.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand: students are (legitimately) frustrated when they're using infrastructure they haven't been extensively trained in, and they can't get it to work. If I try to get them to ask better questions, they'll feel like I'm being deliberately unhelpful and making them jump through hoops to get an answer to their question. (I know this because that's been their reaction the few times I tried this.) They may stop asking questions and just give up on the lab exercises.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Should I risk the actual course goal (delivering content to the students) in favor of a general educational goal (teaching them how to ask questions)?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to train students to ask better questions without making them feel like I'm not helping them?</strong></p>

<p>Just to clarify: I already provide answers to commonly asked questions, and a lot of material to help students formulate better questions <em>before</em> they ask. Some students ignore that material and ask very non-specific questions anyways. My question is how to address this once they've asked the question: should I walk them through the process of reformulating it before I answer? Is there a way to do so without frustrating them further?</p>

<p>If grades, degrees, test scores are important for getting a job/internship/assistantship, even more so than the actual knowledge that they measure, I can see how cheating on a test can be considered unethical. Is it ethically better to hire an expensive tutor to prepare, say, for the SAT or for the GMAT, or for some test at school, than to attempt to cheat on the exam? </p>

<p>Here is some context: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/01/nyregion/01tutor.html"" rel=""nofollow"">New York Times: Tutors Hold Key to Higher Test Scores, for a High Fee </a>.</p>

<p><strong>Assume that the tutor has no secret/insider knowledge about the test</strong>. Assume that the tutor is essentially teaching you only some tricks for beating this particular test, no real knowledge. Assume also that many people in class do not have the money to hire a tutor of the same qualification.</p>

<p>Conversely, is it okay to cheat for those less financially fortunate, if they cannot afford a tutor?</p>

<p>As further context, Princeton Review explicitly states that their SAT prep program does only one thing: raises scores.

<p>But what about advanced practical courses where it is important to ""understand"" rather than ""know""? For example, knowing statistical formulas won't help if you haven't understood how to apply them. Knowing STL commands by heart is also useless for programming, unless you're actually good at programming. Intel's x86 developer manual won't help a complete newbie in Assembly programming.</p>

<p>Therefore the question is whether it is reasonable to believe that good courses should be focused on ""understanding"" the subject rather than ""memorizing"" it, meaning that the instructor should have no problems with his students using paper materials on the exam?</p>

I received such an invitation, but for a number of reasons am not sure yet whether I will attend. </p>

19362,"<p>I work in a field (Philosophy) where co-authorship is uncommon and advisors and grad students very seldomly co-author a paper. I've seen a lot of posts on Academia.se though about the ethics of co-authoring papers with mentors, such <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/19319/is-it-better-to-submit-a-paper-to-an-important-journal-without-the-supervisor-na"">as this question.</a></p>

<p>My sense is that it must be somewhat common in the natural sciences for the head of the lab/dissertation advisor to be automatically added as a co-author to every paper that his or her graduate students produce. </p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this really common, and if so, in which fields?</li>
<li>Is this really ethical? </li>
</ul>

<p>My view is that adding your name to something that you had no part in creating is just plagiarism: it's taking credit for the work of others. </p>

<p>The opposite argument, that the work wouldn't have been possible without the PI's grant funding also cuts no ice. I wouldn't have been able to write my dissertation if my parents hadn't had sex, but that doesn't mean they should get credit as coauthoring my work. </p>

<p>That's the way it seems to me, but maybe somebody from these fields can give us a better rationale for (what seems to be) the widespread practice.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Another argument against the practice. Suppose I'm a billionaire who knows nothing about science, but I take it into my head that I want to be (regarded as) a famous scientist. Suppose I just spend billions of dollars to fund other people to do research. But, I ask each of those people to come and report to me for fifteen minutes ever week about what they've worked on, or discovered that week. Then, every time one of them finds a result, I demand that my name be added to the paper as a co-author, since we have ""discussed"" the work in progress and it is, after all, by my grace that the funds for the work have been provided. Suppose I just have hundreds of these postdocs, producing thousands of papers a year, all of which I am a coauthor for. </p>

<p>Now ask yourself if I really deserve to be regarded as a famous scientist at all? It seems to me that I don't, because I haven't done any of the science--I haven't suggested any research methods, I haven't designed any experiments, I haven't collected any data, I haven't even helped junior researchers know the shape of the existing literature. You might regard my existence as good for science in some sense--you might think of me as a beneficial patron of the sciences. But you wouldn't think of me as a scientist, right? And you wouldn't think I deserved to be considered for a Nobel Prize, or membership in the American Academy of the Arts and Sciences, or whatever. If I demanded that I be given those awards because of the thousands and thousands of papers that I have coauthored, which have been cited tens of thousands of times, you would call me an idiot, right? We give those prizes for discovery, not for being rich. The same thing is true of tenure too. You shouldn't be able to buy your role as a tenured professor. You should have to prove that you, personally, are capable of making a serious contribution to your field. And of course you demonstrate that capability by publishing papers.</p>

<p>So when a prof is automatically added as a coauthor to a paper that he or she did not contribute to in any way except financially, then she is trying to <em>buy</em> a reputation as a scholar, or the other perks like tenure or membership in the AAAS that come with that reputation in just the same kind of way that the absurd billionaire is doing.</p>

19363,"<p>I'm an American professor in a branch of theoretical science at a US institution. There is a Japanese postdoc in our group who has nearly finished writing a paper with one of the American postdocs. We're having a bit of a conflict over authorship: the Japanese postdoc wants my name to be on the publication, and I don't think it's appropriate. I chatted about the project with them while it was in progress and made a few suggestions, but fundamentally all the ideas and computations originated with the two postdocs. I think that they should take full credit for the work and I that I should take none, and this seems consistent with US authorship norms to me. However, the postdoc from Japan seems very unhappy that I don't want to sign my name on the paper. He said that if I don't, then he won't feel like he can discuss his future work-in-progress with me because he will think I am disavowing the work or that I have no time for him. I've insisted that I'm happy to discuss his work, I just think that he deserves his share of credit for it and that if my name is attached it might be perceived by others as more my work than his.</p>

<p>I've never encountered this situation before. At times I've been in the opposite situation, when I was a postdoc, feeling that professors were claiming undue credit for my work, so actively wanting a professor who did none of the actual work to claim authorship is difficult for me to understand. But I assume this is a difference in cultural norms; I know professors from certain countries in our field who have such a large number of publications that it's clear they're claiming authorship over this sort of project that they had very little involvement in. (I don't necessarily mean that as a criticism of them; I think that within their local academic culture, this is expected and ethical behavior.)</p>

19378,"<p>I occasionally provide training resources to the peer tutoring program on campus. The upper-division tutors meet regularly with groups of lower-division students who are taking large gateway science and math classes. One of the barriers to effective tutoring is that the tutor likes to ""lecture"" instead of having the students work on finding their own sources of confusion, seeking solutions, and practicing problem-solving.</p>

<p>I'm pondering the idea of measuring ""talking time"" by the tutor as a simple negative correlation to how active (and good) the tutoring session is. This could be accomplished by having tutors visit each other's sessions and generating an evaluation like this one (1).
As instructors often think they are allowing students to talk more than they actually are, this can enable tutors to work on reducing their ""talking time."" But peer evaluations would add to the tutoring workload.</p>

<p>My main question to the ASE group is: <strong>Are you familiar with any low-cost software that would allow tutors to upload an mp3 recording of their session and would automatically generate a simple ""% of time person X was speaking?""</strong> My searching indicates this is called speaker diarization.

<p>Resources to throw at this are limited, but the tutor trainers are modestly interested in incorporating this as a training technique for the tutors. I'm imagining tutors would make the recordings on their phones and upload them after each session to some cloud-based analysis.</p>

<p>As part of my Masters curriculum in Electrical Engineering I had to do a research project during the semester along with the lectures. This is intended as a hands on methodology in investigation and research in general.
The project turned out to be pretty great (got the highest grade possible), and my supervisor (a PostDoc student at my university) and I were very happy with the results.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> should I contact my supervisor to publish along with him?</p>

<p>The ideas and theoretical proposal came from him. He did assist and help me during the project, but I did all the implementation and writing of the projects paper.</p>

<p>2) Not knowing what I am doing after graduation, I think there is little chance I pursue a PhD.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> should I be trying to get it published altogether or ditch the idea?</p>

<p>I think that even if I do not continue in academia, it is helpful for later on applying to certain industry jobs. I also would like to share the ideas and findings, since I think the work was well-structured and investigated interesting ideas.</p>

<p>To give a bit more background, I am currently a 2nd year undergraduate student doing an 'Advanced' Mathematics degree. At my university there is a 'normal' stream and an 'advanced stream'.

I guess my dilemma is that I don't think I can reasonably put in more hours than I already do in terms of studying (between attending lectures/tutorials and my part time job, I am probably doing about 15 hours a day of university work) - So I am trying to think about other ways that can help me get higher grades. </p>

<p>I should probably also note that my university uses scaling a lot, and so your grades are really just relative to your place amongst your peers. And in this sense, there's really not that much collaboration between peers.</p>

<p>Each semester I have improved a little bit, and have actively tried to think of ways to make my study time more efficient and effective. As an example, in the past, I tried to read the lecture material before I went to class to ensure that I would already understand most of what the lecturer would cover, but I found that between doing this and going to lectures as well, it left me with much less time to actually practice doing questions, rather than reading so much. So now, I usually don't read as much, and just spend more time doing questions and memorizing tactics to approach questions.</p>

<p>I realize that study tips are probably quite specific to the subject and the assessment style, and I guess I'm not looking for a magic formula - but would just like to maybe get some ideas from others on how you have handled competitive undergraduate degrees, and how to maximize assignment and test scores etc.</p>

19454,"<p>This question was raised in discussion of answers on <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/19319/is-it-better-to-submit-a-paper-to-an-important-journal-without-the-supervisor-na/19322?noredirect=1#comment40219_19322"">Is it better to submit a paper to an important journal without the supervisor name or to a less important journal with the supervisor name?</a>  There seemed to be a significant difference of opinion, so I'm asking it here as its own question.  I'll phrase it as a hypothetical.</p>

<p>Suppose that researchers X, Y and Z have collaborated on a project.  Each has made major contributions which were essential to its success, and would ordinarily be entitled to co-authorship on the resulting paper.  However, X decides, for some reason, that she does not wish her name to appear on the paper, but she is willing for Y and Z to publish it under their names alone.  </p>

<p>May Y and Z ethically do so?  </p>

<p>Of course it seems clear that X must consent to have a paper published with her name on it, and she has the right to withhold that consent.  It's less clear whether Y and Z may publish anyway, effectively claiming credit for X's work, even though she consents to them doing so.  It could be argued in this case that Y and Z may not publish the paper at all.</p>

<p>Another possible concern is that, if X has the right to decline credit for her work, she could be pressured or coerced or bribed into doing so, effectively reducing her to a ghost writer.</p>

At one point of time, a new member, who can be a PhD student or a post-doc, is added into a project.

19477,"<p>In general, you can find the past exams for the past 15 years or so at my school. However I had one prof in Calculus III who chose to withhold his exams. This was the only instance in which a prof has chosen to do so in my two years at university studying engineering. His justification was that he didn't want students studying exams rather than the actual course material which I find to be interesting. 
As a student, I notice that solving past exams from the same instructor as practice can be helpful for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>it helps you get accustomed to the instructor's style of exam so you're less nervous when you're writing the actual exam. I find that even seeing the familiar cover page helps in calming me down just before an exam starts.</li>
<li>it  helps you figure out what type of questions the instructor likes to put the focus on (i.e instructor A prefers to put conceptual questions, instructor B hasn't put a question on the laplace transform in 5 years so maybe I'll study that later if I have time, instructor C always has a 2nd-order circuit as question 1, etc...)</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, the 2nd point is exacly why my calculus instructor chose to withhold his exams. But at the same time, some students may benefit if they use them responsibly as challenging practice problems without jeopardizing their learning experience (i.e someone with the mentality of ""I know instructor B hasn't put a question on the laplace transform in 5 years, but I need to study it anyway because it's important""). Most of my other instructors release their past final exams, but do not post full solutions (or full solutions to just last year's exam). A few have chosen to release just the final answers to the questions without the full solution.</p>

<p><em>Is it better for the students if the instructors released the past final exams? What about full solutions (or just final answers) to the finals exams? Are there studies that show if one strategy is better than another?</em></p>

<p>I understand that the answers and arguments may vary depending on the field so I should add that I am particularly interested in an answer for the fields of mathematics, science, and engineering.</p>

I managed once persuade him not to send the payment for the a year ago, but now they wrote him again and he sent them the money and came to me to say that they accepted our article.

19495,"<p>This year I have decided to take a Computer Science course on FLVS, an online learning institution. </p>

<p>Throughout the whole year, I worked well, and I had a lot of fun with the course. I was close to finishing the second semester of it, and I randomly lost access to the course. I was surprised to find out that they took a some of my assignments (about 6~7), and they flagged me for academic integrity, claiming that I used the answers from an online answer source. Another problem is that because it's so many assignments, they have kicked me out of the course, without me even communicating with them the issue. </p>

<p>My teacher had no idea about this, and she can't do anything about it. She told me to talk to academic integrity themselves. I now have a 0 for the course, and I'm very angry, and I have no idea what to do. I can show them I didn't cheat by answering on the phone any questions they have, and I've already studied for the exam and I plan on taking it, and I'm very confident I can get a good grade. I've also used the knowledge I've learned from the course, and I've created iPhone applications as well as games and other software. </p>

<p>I've left the academic integrity team a message stating that I need to speak with them ASAP, but how can I communicate to them that I didn't plagiarize the work?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I have done some research as to how I present my case, and I found a couple things regarding appeals. FLVS claims that it's so called ""academic integrity"" team is fair and not biased and they utilize a lot of technology to ensure that their claims are as factual as possible, such as www.turnitin.com. I have found a Customer Support number that I can voice my concerns to, so I'm going to present my case to them.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE #2:</strong> After speaking with customer support (see update above), the person on the other line wrote down my grievance in an email, and she sent it to the academic integrity people. I also received a copy of the email. She told me she's sorry for my problem and taht I should expect a call in the next 48-72 business hours. Hopefully I will fix this.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE #3:</strong> We had a long talk with the academic integrity team yesterday, and apparently (I had no knowledge of this) they claim I have copied work from my twin brother Varun from about 20 assignments. Going through these assignments, there seems to be evidence of similar code, but that's because certain instance variables and functions had to be created as per the assignment's instructions, but the overall design of the program is different. They also say that we had the same typesetting (meaning me had him the same spacing and tabs and white space), although we're both very experienced programmers, and we follow the conventional format of tabbing and spacing. I'm most likely going to court :D.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE #4:</strong> This is the best part. After talking we academic integrity before (see above update), we decided to check all of the assignments she flagged and come up with legitimate reasons as to why I didn't cheat on them. After coming up with a long list, we sent an email to the academic integrity people and told them that we came up with a lot of reasons as to why we didn't copy, so she said that she would call us in a couple of days. After 2 days, she sends another email stating that her reasons are legitimate, according to her ""boss"", and that she won't discuss the issue any further. I am now super angry about this, and I have legitimate reasons as to how I didn't cheat. She won't tell me anything, and my teachers haven't returned any of my calls. I really hate FLVS.</p>

19576,"<p>Last year I got accepted in a full time informatics MSc. During that period I also had a fulltime job as a software developer in a startup and I was trying to make some publications with my thesis supervisor from my BSc. However all these simultaneous activities had a very negative impact on me, since I had no free time and I slept very little time every day for an extended period of time. Things became worse when a close relative of mine died.</p>

<p>As a result I decided to quit my job and although we managed to publish some papers with my supervisor I decided to end my collaboration with him as well <strong>(although it was very fruitful) .</strong></p>

<p>The aforementioned situations also had a great negative impact in my studies and as a result I passed only 2 out of 5 courses in the first semester.</p>

<p>My studies are really important to me as I want to pursue a PhD. Therefore i decided to fully focus on the MSc and improve my grades. So, during last summer I managed to pass almost every course I failed with high grades. </p>

<p>Recently my BSc thesis supervisor called me offering a job in a research program.
This job interests me a lot since:</p>

<ul>
<li>I would really like to work with him again since we had a great
collaboration...</li>
<li>there is a high chance of publishing again...</li>
<li>I would also earn some money...</li>
</ul>

<p>However:
I am afraid that this may impact negatively once again:</p>

<ul>
<li>my studies (<strong>despite being close to the completion of the MSc</strong>)</li>
<li>my grades (and as a result this could possibly affect getting accepted in a PhD)</li>
<li>my personal life ( I will not have any free time once again)</li>
</ul>

<p>I am afraid that if I refuse the offer, he may deny future collaboration.</p>

<p>What is your advice about this ?
Should I accept the job or would that possibly be a bad idea ?</p>

19581,"<p>I'm currently writing a paper on analysing miRNA targeting in animals. It's principally a statistical analysis involving many graphs.</p>

<p>However, to explain the creation of one of the graphs, I've resorted to using set theory notation, as this, to me, seemed the most efficient way of explaining how the graph was produced. </p>

<p>However, this may potentially have some issues:</p>

<p>1) Will the use of terminology that is outside the theme of papers in this field detract from the description? Such that few people who read this paper will understand set theory and therefore many will not understand the mathematical notation? The description, I hasten to add, will be a tenth of the length when using set theory notation.</p>

<p>2) Evidently, concepts should always be written as clearly as possible, but where is the line formed between explaining concepts in words, as opposed to mathematical notation? Why would one choose one way over another?</p>

<p>3) Should you make assumption of the mathematical understanding of a person reading the paper?</p>

19584,"<p>Why are Linguistics and Law considered as part of the ""sciences"" rather than ""non-science"" academic disciplines like say philosophy, history or engineering?</p>

<p>Seeing how both Linguistics and Law only study what has been created by mankind to begin with, or how there is virtually no room for scientists to actually test out various theories and models, it would seem, to me, that both of these fields fail to meet the criteria for being a ""science"", which is enlarging humanities pool of verified/easily-testable knowledge.</p>

<p>Or to perhaps phrase the question in a less abstract way, how do the Linguists' methods for reaching consensus differ from the methods of historians, which basically is ""just"" some majority of people agreeing on something based, ultimately, on their intuition. (In contrast to something like math where one can provide formal proofs, or sociology where one can run experiments and tests that meet certain criteria for validity and significance). Similarly, isn't Law ""merely"" applying the knowledge provided by sociology (and others) and thus more of an engineering discipline rather than a science?</p>

<p>Or is it perhaps like with Computer Science (and various other examples) where the field is just called a science for practical (political/economical/etc.) reasons, but actually fails to formally meet the criteria upon closer examination?</p>

<p>I am asking this question because I am drawing up a home-library database application, and the client would like the ability to assign call numbers (even multiple ones). I have not been able to find an answer online, and I hope that I do not have to travel to the next state over to find a library not connected to the ones around I live.</p>

<p>I imagine the book would most likely be assigned to the same top-tier category and most likely the same second subcategory in the respective system, but, for example, the Library of Congress system incorporates the author's name and a quasi-decimal number which fine-tunes the book's location. And it seems without any external reference the assignment of this part of the call number is made on the fly for any particular library.</p>

19635,"<p>To give some background, I am a TA at UCLA for a lab class. They submit their assignments to TurnItIn, which you may know highlights any text pulled from another place.</p>

<p>I made it clear that they are not to work together and that no text in their reports should be found ""anywhere else in the universe.""</p>

<p>After the first week I caught a group of two plagiarizing. I repeated the ""your text should not be found anywhere else in the universe"" talk. I gave a long speech about academic honesty and such. One of the plagiarizing students dropped the class herself. I didn't take action on the other, besides a stern talking-to.</p>

<p>This week, two more students blatantly copied chunks of the other's paper. Whole paragraphs. I couldn't believe it -- I had just explained to them the week prior how easy it was to spot plagiarism. I brought them outside class one at a time and asked them what happened. I showed them the highlighted TurnItIn gradereport and their reports side-by-side. They each said they worked together, but didn't copy (slim chance. And still against the rules.)</p>

<p>Now the issue:</p>

<p>The professor that oversees my class doesn't have time to talk to me; hence I am here. He has given me two options: do nothing, or report them to the Dean of Students. If I do the latter, the punishment will extend beyond their grade -- they will probably fail the class, or even be suspended.</p>

19716,"<p>My situation is as follows: I spent my undergraduate time at one university and recently entered grad school at another university (both of them in Germany, my field is theoretical computer science).</p>

<p>For my Bachelor's thesis, I worked (for about two months or so) on a topic that had not been considered at the time.</p>

<p>My former supervisor, although he proposed the topic, is not (at least not for the last 30 years) actively doing research in that specific area, which resulted in me ending up quite on my own. However, I could get some new results. They were, of course, not groundbreaking, but sufficient for the undergraduate level and the amount of time spent working on the thesis.</p>

<p>So we submitted the results to a (medium-to-low-ranked) conference in the subfield.
The reviews were quite mixed. Two were rather superficial: One positively and recommending acceptance, one negatively and recommending rejection (actually, the latter one was quite rude).</p>

<p>The third one, however, although recommending for rejection, was quite encouraging. The reviewer liked the idea of the paper, while the results we obtained did not suffice for publication at conference level but (his words) were rather suited for venues for work in progress, e.g. workshops in the area.</p>

<p>I actually agree with the third reviewer, for it would have been quite a surprise for me if a second-year undergraduate would have been able to produce publishable work on his own just like that, so I am not that disappointed.</p>

<p>My problem is that I do not plan on pursuing that specific subarea of research in the future and neither does my former supervisor. However, given that I ultimately aim for an academic career, I think it might be worth some efforts to get something published. Additionally, at my new university, nobody really cares about the area of the thesis, so chances to get some expert here to work with in order to improve the results are rather bad. This means that if I want something to happen, I would have to invest a vast amount of time and thoughts into a topic I don't want to pursue in the future, instead of entering new areas of research as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>So: Should I improve the results and finally get them published or should I invest the time for acquiring knowledge in a different area (and start publishing later) and abandon the work that has been done (giving away a possible publication) (w.r.t. the impact of the outcome on my academic career)? </p>

<p>The first reviewer say that I need to carry out a lot more experiments that will involve a lot of cost, which is not practical. However, in the comment, s/he only suggests one additional experiment that need to be done. The second reviewer complains about the quality of the figures, but I think they are fixable. The third reviewer complains about the novelty of the paper but I think s/he did not carefully read and understand the paper.</p>

19727,"<p>With apologies for the attention-grabbing title: of course I am not actually asking you to tell me when I, specifically, should schedule my defense. But I have heard very plausible-sounding rumors that the time of day at which a PhD candidate holds their thesis defense can have an impact on the difficulty and even the candidate's chance of passing. For example, scheduling a defense just before lunch may mean the committee will ask fewer and less involved questions, because they will be anxious to finish so they can go eat. Similarly defending in the mid afternoon may lead to less complex questions because everyone is tired - or alternatively it could cause a <em>more</em> difficult defense because the committee members are in no hurry to get back to work. And so on; the rumors abound.</p>

19747,"<p>I am a PhD student at an engineering department in Europe. At my department, and at most others in my university, research papers are the main benchmark of a scientist’s productivity. It seems like this is also true in other institutions.</p>

<p>For instance, last year the faculty considered the number of journal papers for each department a key performance indicator, and when a PhD student is at the end of his/her studies, he/she is often judged by colleagues based on how many papers they have published. </p>

<p>There is no threshold of a number of papers required in order to obtain a PhD or a senior position, and conference papers are also relevant and encouraged, but counting journal papers is the key point. In the end, a PhD thesis is just the sum of published papers during the PhD studies, and itself is not that relevant.</p>

<p>Naturally, I feel pressured to publish and to have lots of papers to support my upcoming degree. It seems to make sense - if you have a result, why wouldn't you publish it in a journal? Why wait for the thesis, when it's not really published and nobody will read it? And after all, submitting research to journals and conferences is also beneficial for getting a review of the research from someone who is outside one's department.</p>

<p>However, recently I realized that a friend of mine, also an engineer in a related field, received a PhD from another university with 0 journal papers, and just 1 conference paper where she was a second author. Her university is well regarded, and on almost all world rankings in the top 100. She was accepted for a post-doc position at another top university. I have seen a few other similar cases, and other people just not caring about papers.</p>

<p>I cannot judge the work presented in her thesis, but I found this shocking, and it made me reconsider. How can one be well regarded with hardly any publications? Why would anyone choose not to publish (not counting the thesis as the bare minimum)?</p>

<p><strong><em>Hence my questions:</em></strong> How relevant are (journal) papers in terms of valuation of a fresh PhD, and for their future career?</p>

<p>I would like to thank everyone for their reply, especially @Superbest for the edit (sorry, I am not a native English speaker), I didn't expect that my question would generate such a discussion.
I'd like to clarify some things:</p>

<ul>
<li>In my field conference papers are less relevant than journal papers, and are used to present research in progress in order to get comments and advices.</li>
<li>The graduate didn't publish a revolutionary paper which is worth like 10 other average papers. We are talking about a zero. I see no reason why would anyone choose NOT to publish at least one paper about a PhD.</li>
<li>Even if the graduate had very good recommendations, why would anyone in academia, which depends on publications, hire someone without any publication record? Why would a professor think that the graduate would suddenly start to be productive?</li>

19750,"<p>I let a student associated with me (but who is not really my PhD student) submit a paper to a fairly-local meeting (some people do come from abroad). Because I'd been tasked with supporting the student, I let him put my name on the paper and also helped with the presentation, but I found the content unconvincing.  However, he was exploring an area that I knew little about and had little interest in, so I'd hoped he'd get reviews &amp; (if accepted) discussion that would give him more guidance than I have been able to. </p>

<p>In fact, no one seemed as sceptical as I was of the work, and it got into the meeting and was presented both in our department and at the meeting with if anything positive comments.  </p>

<p>However, yesterday I got an email from a postdoc who was cited in the paper (the student compared himself to the postdoc's work, the meeting's papers are on a website, Google Scholar alerted the postdoc) and was incensed at <strong>the paper's low quality and inaccuracies</strong>.  I think the postdoc is being a bit paranoid, but is broadly right on the technical issues. I have also previously noticed that one of my more-successful colleagues I've been collaborating with recently had a less tolerant attitude towards student publication than I do. </p>

<p>I'm wondering if I should put more effort on quality control.

19762,"<p>When I'm teaching an advanced graduate class where the source material is drawn primarily from current research papers, there isn't a canonical text per se, and a typical lecture, while loosely structured, also involves discussion that might help clarify the papers. </p>

19785,"<p>I'm an international graduate student studying theoretical physics in a US university, and I'm in my 4th year of PhD study and plan to graduate at the end of the 5th year. Yesterday, I heard something from my advisor really hurts me.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, I was working in my office while my professor was having a meeting with a prostdoc in our group in the small meeting room just outside my office. We are in a suit-like office so that there is a very small common meeting room outside our offices. The meeting room is very small and very close to my office, so that I can hear what they said rather clearly. Usually I will close my office door when there is a meeting outside, but yesterday I left my door opened because my professor planed to have a meeting with me after they finished the meeting with the postdoc, and there was only a short period of time between they started the meeting with the postdoc till the time we scheduled to meet.</p>

<p>And then in the middle of their talk, I heard my professor talking about she was very happy about a new graduate student is about to join the group, so that the new student can help the postdoc to run part of the numerical calculations, because ""XX is not productive as before"", where ""XX"" is my name.</p>

<p>As a background, before the new postdoc joined our group about 3 months ago, I had a great time working together with our former postdoc, who is also international with the same nationality as I'm. We worked very closely together with many of the projects, and published several papers together in about two years. Just before the end of last year, my professor assigned me to work independently onto a new project which is in a new area that no one in our group has any experience before. It went smoothly until early this year when I plan to take my general exam. I originally plan to take my general exam at late February, but until the very end of approaching the exam data, the exam was rescheduled one month later and moved into March, due to misunderstanding of emails between our department and the graduate school. So in that two months period, I almost stopped updating the new project and totally devoted into the preparation of my general exam. After I passed my general exam at the end of March, I thought I could pick up my research, then I was caught by another unfinished project we started last summer. This project is a collaboration between our group and an experimental group, and we did have some disagreement of the results between the experimental data and the theoretical simulations from the beginning. Then this project get stop-and-go until just after my general exam, we get pushes from the experimental side that they want to finish the project and submit a paper soon. Since the former postdoc is already left, I was placed to in charge of it. I have to deal with all the conflicts between the experiment and theory results and exchange drafts of the paper with the experimental side, and almost have no time to deal with the new project I was doing. The last important update of my project is about 7 weeks ago.</p>

<p>I think I'm a hard working student, at least in the standards of my friends in my department. I work almost 10 hours a day and almost 7 days a week. After I hear about her criticism yesterday, I almost started to rethink whether it still worth my devotion into this.</p>

<p>So, what should I take from my professor's criticism of my performance, in her talking with others, under the obvious condition that I can hear it? She never criticized me before as far as I know. And what suggestions do you have to deal with this situation?</p>

<p>As these points are rather opinion-based, I do not intend to elaborate on them in the paper – at most I might shortly mention the didactical aspects in the conclusion.
(I mainly mentioned them here to give you some idea what I am talking about.)
However, I do want to briefly mention in the abstract or the introduction that I “rigorified” the formalism, where <em>briefly</em> can be anything between one word and two sentences.
For example, my abstract could look like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Old paper] introduced [old concept], which is useful for [application].
  We extend this concept to [new concept] and also <em>rigorify its mathematical background.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My problem is that <em>rigorify its mathematical background</em> is far from what I actually want to say.
I am therefore looking for <strong>a way to say this without seeming arrogant or condescending on the old paper and in particular without implying that the old paper “did not do its mathematics properly”.</strong></p>

<p>I intentionally do not give my best solutions for now, as I do not want to induce any bias on them, in case I may underestimate them.</p>

19822,"<p>I'm a CS master student working on my thesis. I'm 25 years old and still until now when I wake up in the morning to start studying I wake up stressed and my stomach hurts. I also feel a very bad headache. When I had courses I used to wake up in this situation everyday because I had to. Now I started my thesis and I don't have a deadline for it. So now when I try to wake up very early in the morning (7am) I end up surrendering to stay in bed because I don't want to have that ugly feeling in the morning. I noticed that now I wake up at 9 or 10 am. This is making me waste a lot of time. I'm not working as hard as I used to be.</p>

<p>My questions are: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>does everyone has this feeling in the morning? and how to overcome this feeling?</p></li>
<li><p>how do you motivate yourself to work?</p></li>

19826,"<p>A while back I reached the stage where my ideas for research topics/papers exceeded my capacity to personally work on them. As a PostDoc, I tried to head-hunt students or more junior researchers in my area (or at conferences, etc.) to talk with them about the ideas and see if they would be interested in collaborating or co-authoring a paper. This worked well for a while.</p>

<p>But now (more recently) I find that I again have a back-log of promising topics that have exceeded my capacity to even advise/delegate. I have no students to work on them. The ideas are mixed in quality, concreteness, promise, etc. and I'm saving some of the ones I am most interested in for myself or for students. But I know that there are others I will have to neglect (and I often choose the ""safer"" topics since being in tenure-track, I have a constant hunger for publications).</p>

<p>Now I have a text file on my hard-drive with a list of sketches of ideas so that I remember them. But a lot of the details are left unexpressed in my head; most of the ideas in the text file would be pretty meaningless in their current form without some explanation, further development, context and/or motivation from me. At the same time, I have sufficient experience to know that there are interesting paper/thesis topics in there that I could help develop and/or advise if I had the time/money.</p>

<p>For some of the topics, I have been saying ""<a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/274079-sure-baby-ma-ana-it-was-always-ma-ana-for-the-next"">some day</a>"" for too long.</p>

<p>In any case, I cannot imagine I am alone in this. I am sure that various researchers see many potentially promising research topics fall ""by the wayside"" due to more urgent, day-to-day matters. I sometimes wonder if other professors similarly have lists of research topics that just rot away in a text file somewhere. It would seem like such a waste if this were the case: think about the union of all these text files sitting on local hard-drives! It would seem to be a major flaw in the academic research system if this were prevalent: that the sharing of raw (or perhaps lightly pasteurised) ideas is not properly incentivised by ""the system"".</p>

<hr>

<p>The question ...</p>

<p><strong>Assuming I have a surplus of (good) ideas for research topics in my area – that I cannot work on myself and cannot delegate or even find time to actively advise – what should I do with them?</strong></p>

<p>To avoid a loss of generality, a good answer should assume that I'm not a nice guy: <strong>what personal incentive would I have for sharing my ideas in this manner?</strong> I don't want to give away my ideas for free. These ideas require development and expression before they can be shared (which is difficult to do ""up front""). If I am not incentivised to develop the ideas into a shareable form, the reality is that I will use my precious time to do something else I <em>am</em> incentivised to do.</p>

<p>In studying for biology courses I feel as though I have to take things at face value. Is there a way to get around this and study from a more logical standpoint? I can memorize things but don't want to because I know from experience that I will forget about them later.</p>

<p>I am interested in studying disorders that are genetic in origin. However, I am having difficulty in understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms regarding processes such as meiosis, mitosis, and recombination. I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to study these processes from a physical standpoint. When I took a class that discussed these principles, I felt that it was more memorization rather than a deep understanding of concepts such as these. Again to ask my question, does anyone know about a physical (i.e., classical mechanical/electrodynamical(magnetic) or quantum mechanical/statistical mechanical/quantum electrodynamical and thermodynamic/kinetic) way of viewing these interactions and the logic behind why certain things happen in the manner that they do. I know that this is vague. I wish that I had taken cell biology first, then molecular biology and then genetics and developmental biology rather than the way that I was advised to.

19867,"<p><em>(This question is set up under the EECS context, but any generic answer is much welcomed)</em></p>

<p>It is said that publications during one's undergraduate time will be an advantage in his/her PhD application. Usually, an undergraduate only starts publishing papers in his/her junior (3rd) year, and the application deadline usually comes at the end of his/her junior year. Hence, it is very likely that although the paper has been accepted by or even already presented in a certain conference, yet it has not been included into IEEE Xplore.</p>

<p>If the student has not uploaded the paper to some preprint database, such as arXiv or ResearchGate, then the admission committee will have no access to the paper. Of course, they may still be able to find some information about the paper, e.g., a tittle and an abstract appearing in the conference schedule, but after all they cannot go deeper into the paper content.</p>

<h1>Questions</h1>

<ul>
<li>Does the admission committee even bother to go through the paper to assess the work quality? (Sometimes, you can have a rough quality assessment by looking at which journal/conference the paper is accepted by)</li>
<li>If the answer is positive, is it a good idea for the applicant to upload the papers to arXiv and provide the committee with the links so that the committee can read the papers as they wish?</li>

<ol>
<li>What do you consider the best practices for advisors, other committee members, and candidates in order to move the dissertation writing along efficiently? </li>
<li>Does the <em>Journal Review</em> policy (specified below) seem reasonable to you? </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Journal Review Method</strong></p>
  
  <p>In this model, the dissertation advisor treats his or her role as the
  chair of the candidate's committee as if he or she were the editor of
  a journal and the dissertation chapters articles submitted for review.
  The student submits a chapter to the advisor who decides whether it is
  ready to send for review. If it is, then the advisor sends the chapter
  to committee members for review. The committee members make a brief
  (2-4 page) report to the advisor that either: accepts the chapter as
  is, accepts it pending minor revisions, rejects it pending major
  revisions, or rejects the chapter entirely. The advisor then makes the
  final determination as to the status of the chapter. It will be the

This project will serve as a final for one of our classes.</p>

<p>Originally, we agreed that I would write the server and he would write the mobile application. I stayed up for a couple nights straight and got together a working server in no time. He told me he was bogged down with papers/family life/etc., but he'd handle the client side.</p>

When another week went by and still no work had been done, I went ahead and wrote a good deal of the client code. My partner is also my friend and I trusted him when he told me he would do his part and he was just totally bogged down.</p>

About 6 months ago I started an after-hours (does such a thing exist?) project with a fellow graduate student in a different lab doing computational physics. We principally work on the weekends and late at night, and I like to think that the time we use would otherwise have been spent playing video games, drinking, etc (not doing lab work), but who really knows?</p>

<p>Our collaboration has been extraordinarily fruitful and we have one paper ~90% written, and a follow up ~50% written.

Also, both our PIs know and are supportive of us pursuing this project, and neither has so much as even hinted at wanting authorship. And neither is an expert (or even an amateur..) in physics.</p>

<p>1) Should we include our PIs? They could potentially contribute to editing and big picture, but are not able to even assess the validity of what we've accomplished. As an ""experienced"" graduate student I know they shouldn't be authors, but they are also making it possible for us spend our time thinking, and they've supported our endeavor at least in spirit.</p>

For example, there is a third faculty member in this area who we've had some discussion of the science with, and who is a computational physicist. Should we include him on the manuscript as a signature of credibility? Should he be last author or a middle author, if so? If there are any physicists perusing, I'd be particularly interested in your thoughts, as my experience in publishing has been solely in the biomedical journals so far.</p>

20016,"<p>I recently submitted a paper to a conference and was just blown away by the quality of the reviews (double-blind). Not only were they very detailed, but they were also very informative and insightful. They really helped me move the work forward. I wanted to thank the reviewers (which I got a chance to do in the rebuttal stage) but also to perhaps even contact them for a follow up on their comments. I thought that I could perhaps add them as co-authors or even offer collaborations.</p>

<p>I was wondering if people thought whether or not it would be appropriate for journal editors or program committees to allow reviewers to connect with the author following the end of the review cycle should it be requested by either side. What would the down-side of such a follow-up system be?</p>

20017,"<p>I'm about to graduate in Computer Engineering in Brazil but during the course I saw that we do not learn much deep math. We only do learn the common engineering math core (calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, etc) but we do not go any deep in most abstract concepts. Even though it may not be necessary I would like to expand my knowledge in pure math so I was about to enter in a bachelor of math program here.</p>

<p>However, I seek to study in USA and I heard that many people do not recommend a second Bachelor degree. It was better to try a Master program. The problem is that, at least here in brazil, an equivalent to a Master program is somehow a more advanced course than a Bachelor program. In other words, I would be specializing myself in an specific area of math.</p>

<p>But what I really want is to learn things that a bachelor of math should learn except for what I've already seen in the engineering program (which we may go deep in differential equations field for example while we do not see almost anything of abstract algebra).</p>

<p>So the question is: is there a chance I find a master program in USA which fits me (a master program which is almost like a bachelor program but I could choose the missing courses of my engineering program)?</p>

<p>Or should I try a second bachelor program?</p>

<p>Such statements usually sound lazy to me, as though the author opted not to do a literature search at the outset, and after learning of previous work the author opted not to edit the paper (or withdraw it from submission for publication) beyond adding one sentence.

20040,"<p>I have seen several questions on this forum that have similar things and some of them have been quite satisfying for my quest. But I want to mention my specific case and want to have some useful suggestions, so I am writing this, which maybe or may not be a redundant question.</p>

<p>In my work as a research associate, I always have this problem which sucks me a lot.</p>

<p>Every time at the start I have to study something, of course related to my area but a some what new for me (painful, but this is what anybody has to take it to get the job done), learn it and apply it (I would say the apply part is the sweet/joyful pain).</p>

<p>Suddenly the next demand comes as <strong>""Write down""</strong> and it is where the pain concern ends and I start feeling as if my hands are cut and my mind is blank and <strong>""ME""</strong> can never do it.</p>

<p>Sometimes the demand is <strong>""Write down and make it as long as you can and we will make it short later""</strong>, the torture is, for God sake I do not have even a few words to write!!!</p>

<p><strong>Problem as I feel it:</strong> </p>

<p>Even after doing every thing by myself, I feel that I can not describe it in writing. While if it is about describing it orally I am confident that I am much better than many. </p>

<p>When it comes to writing, I never know what to include and what not, especially when the demand is about <strong>as long as you can</strong>. I have had read tens of writings and have had done the things practically by myself but no idea what makes my mind blank about writing technical things.</p>

<p>I feel myself really good at doing technical things and love it.</p>

<p>Finally, I think I am missing some steps involved in that writing and I never miss the steps of doing things practically making me successful in that.</p>

<p>If these are steps, what are these?</p>

<p>If these are not the steps, what else are these?</p>

<p>Many times I have got my office reputation destroyed because of going blank even after many days/weeks given to me for writing. I want to get rid-off this problem and want it never happen again. I would love to be the guy who satisfies the demand of <strong>as long as you can</strong>?</p>

<p>A foot note: In general I do not feel myself bad at writing, though my answers to most emails and my own emails are mostly brief but satisfy the receivers. One more thing to mention that might be useful to asses/suggest me is that it took me around 1 hour to complete this question from A-Z.</p>

20041,"<p>My coauthors and I have just had a paper accepted by a journal.  The journal in question is published by a nonprofit professional society and offers two options in their copyright agreement.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We transfer copyright to the publisher, as is traditional.  The journal has exclusive publication rights but we retain the rights to post the paper on our web pages or arXiv (post peer-review), distribute to colleagues, etc.  We also have the right to release our paper to the public domain after 28 years.</p></li>
<li><p>We retain the copyright for ourselves, but grant exclusive publication rights to the publisher.  We still have the rights to post and distribute the paper privately as before.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am trying to determine the pros and cons of each option.  From a practical standpoint there doesn't seem to be much difference: in each case, both we authors and the journal have the rights to do the things that we respectively care about.</p>

<p>In principle, it would seem better for us to retain the copyright rather than transfer it, just on the grounds that it is better to keep as many rights as possible.  I could only think of one possible drawback: suppose that a number of years from now, some person X wants to republish our paper, or use it in some other way that requires the permission of the copyright holder.  If we transfer it, X can work it out directly with the journal, who should remain easy to contact.  If we don't, X has to track down all three of us authors (or our heirs) to get permission, and then we have to decide what to do about it.</p>

20049,"<p>I teach at a community college in California, where students can drop a course with a grade of ""W"" up until the 12th week of the semester. Within the last year or so, I seem to be seeing an increase in the number of students who find themselves passing the course at the 12th week, but who decide to drop because they want a better grade and are willing to take the course again later. However, I'm not sure that this increase is real, since my sample size is small. And if it is real, I don't know how widespread the phenomenon is or how to probe for possible causes for the change, since a number of different variables have changed in this time frame (including changes in state law and school policy).</p>

<p>Is there any source of hard data or method for getting data on this? I think there's a pretty big literature on student success and persistence, but the impression I get is that a lot of the literature takes it as a matter of definition that if the student doesn't pass the course with a C, it's because the student didn't ""succeed,"" i.e., the student's academic performance wasn't passing. It seems like it would be difficult to gather statistically robust data to measure the phenomenon of drops due to grade dissatisfaction, since instructors aren't systematically asked to submit or retain the grade records of students who are no longer enrolled at the end of the term.</p>

For those with experience serving as editors: would an incorrect but correctable proof of a main theorem cause you to reject outright a paper you would otherwise accept, or is this more likely to lead to a recommendation of major revisions? I say correctable because neither the theorem nor the (correct) proof is particularly surprising in the context of the problem, and there's a good chance a referee with experience in the subfield would, upon discovering the mistake, have a rough idea of the correct approach to take.

I did a little bit of research and took a fair number of upper level classes (although no grad courses) along the way.</p>

Will programs throw out applications from current grad students if their GRE scores are too low? To be honest I do feel a bit silly thinking about retaking it. Of course, any advice on transferring between programs in general will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>But i gotta do it. I am in college. And i need this job.</p>

<p>For my rehearsal, in two days, i need something that would show i can control the group of 20 kids of age 5-11 and make it useful activity for them. I need to do some activity. However i can't think of anything. It doesn't have to be unique..something very general but that works.</p>

<p>It's important that i do this the for rehearsal even if i fake it. Because my main duties would be to help in H.W. which i can do easily as I am pro at Math. But dealing with 20 kids upfront is hard especially you are seeing them first time. </p>

<p>Did i mention i am esl too. I speak retarded. </p>

<p>I need an activity that requires minimum speaking from me, lot of fun for class, and something can be learned from it.</p>

<p>I was thinking like everyone sings some song (abc..:'')..and as soon as i stop everyone sits down. And whoever is last one to sit..i choose her/him to start singing the song from wherever we left...this is engaging at their level. And fun. </p>

<p>Activities should be 20 mins long so like 3 activities. Please help me.</p>

20133,"<p>I was speaking with few of professors in my department about submission to high profile conferences like CHI in Human Computer Interaction. Most of the professors were of opinion that acceptance in most of these high profile conferences (typical acceptance rate of less than 20%) is heavily influenced by politics like even though you may have comparatively  good research, the editors will most likely be more favored toward accepting papers published by MS research or Google research or from other profile universities where they have close relationship with the faculty and researchers.</p>

<p>The professors advised me against spending time and resources on publishing to these conferences and instead concentrate on second ring journals (like those published by Springer) for better ROI of my efforts.</p>

<p>I assume in good faith that most of the editors may not reject papers without reading them, but does anybody concur with opinion of professors at my department?</p>

My supervisor has told me to finish up a draft of paper for submission, I wrote it, then after few months, he told me to correct some parts and did more experiments on certain area, I followed all his instructions and wrote a second draft to him. And until now, it is already one year after sending my draft to him, and still I have no idea when he will publish it.</p>

<p>Actually, this not only happens to me, it happens to all the members in my research group. The average time my supervisor publishes our results is about 2-3 years after we have finished all the required experiments. The results just become idle. I would like to ask, if this is a common phenomenon (and the possible reasons behind it), if not, what I (and my colleagues) can do about it? You know as a research student, having publication is very important, it is really frustrating.   </p>

20146,"<p>I am trying to use/find the correct term for the <em>practice of publishing research results in academia</em>, mainly a reference to the practice of publishing research findings in a formal journal or conference. </p>

<p>The term has to have a clear contrast to the practice of <em>publishing full data-sets of research results (ex: in a repository)</em>, but which is also a sub-form of ""publishing of research results"" </p>

<p>I have started my work by using the term ""Scholarly Communication"" which was somehow influenced by one of my mentors. Although I was happy on the initial suggestion, I am finding myself not so keen on the use of it, as it seems cheaper in contrast to for example: <em>Academic Publishing</em> which seems broader to include more research ventures (done also by non-scholars, but still viable for academic recognition).</p>

<p>The problems with the term <em>Academic Publishing</em> are two for my perspective. 1) I have not been able to find a strong definition of it, and 2) it is so broad that can include the ""publishing of research data-sets"" which I need to reference separately.  </p>

20188,"<p>In a paper published recently in a math journal, the main result is presented as being new, but in fact it is not new, and I'm sure that the authors knew this before submitting the paper.  I have informed the journal editor who handled this paper, who told me he would forward my message to the managing editor.  I have not heard anything since then.  What else can (or should) I do?</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I am a tenured professor.</p>

<p>In more detail, there was a previous paper [A] which proved a certain result (1).  The proof given in [A] actually proves a stronger result (2) which has a messy statement, and notes that (2) implies (1) (where (1) has a simple statement).  The main result (3) of the recent paper [B] implies (1), but is implied by (2).  Moreover, the proof in [B] is identical to the proof in [A] (and the authors of [B] say this in their paper), except that the proof in [B] uses a stronger auxiliary result at one step.  So the authors of [B] must have been aware of the stronger result (2) proved in [A], but they do not mention (2) in their paper, and certainly do not mention that their main result follows immediately from (2).  To me, this shows that the authors of [B] published their paper under false pretenses, by intentionally misrepresenting prior work.  In addition, the auxiliary result mentioned above is presented as a new result in [B], even though it has been published several times and also the authors of [B] were fully aware of this fact, since they had written previous papers citing an essentially identical result from a paper [C].  Even beyond this, the paper [C] contains a result which is stronger than (1), (2), or (3), although the authors of [B] do not mention this.</p>

<p>If people think I am overreacting, I would be happy to hear this.  It's possible that my views of proper academic behavior are not standard ones.  I don't have a fully articulated philosophy about these things, I just feel like the authors did something wrong and should not benefit from doing it.</p>

20196,"<p><em>I tried to search in the previous Q/As, but I do not think my case falls in any of the previous entries.</em></p>

<p>While looking for a certain topic in my field, I found two papers. 
The first paper was authored by authors A, B, C, and D and published in some conference proceedings. The second paper was published in a journal in a year after by authors A, E, D, and C. That is, the second paper lost one author and gained a new author.</p>

<p>The two papers report the same research hypotheses, the same data collected, the same data analysis, the same results. That is, the ""numbers"" in the papers are the same (even the table contents).</p>

<p>The texts differ in a subtle way. The first paper is entitled ""Studying topic T in the domain D"". The second paper is entitled ""Using Measurement Instrument M to measure T in the domain D"". The second paper somehow avoids copy/pasting of the paragraphs from the first paper-they rewrote the sentences. It is a little bit longer than the first one. The authors actually spent some more words talking about measurement instrument M, which is taken from another discipline and it takes 3 minutes of Google Scholar searching for learning more about it. There is even a Wikipedia page about the instrument.</p>

<p><em>I think</em> that this is a case of self-plagiarism. The second paper does not add anything useful to the first one. Additionally, <em>the second paper does not cite the first one</em>. This ringed a bell.</p>

<p>Please note that in my field, conferences are archived and are often considered more important than journals. Regardless of which venues are more important, both papers are formally considered publications.</p>

<p>Now, am I morally obliged to contact the editor of the journal where the second paper was published? This is not precisely a double publication, nor are the authors damaging me nor anybody else. Still, <em>I feel</em> they did something wrong. Should I instead live and let die?</p>

20214,"<p>I have been teaching a humanities course at a higher education institution for about more than three years now. I am expected to get full tenure this year. Perhaps it is the only chair dedicated to my field in my country; it is certainly the only one in the subfield I teach. In other words, yes, I am the only professor who teaches that subject in the whole country, and the only professor totally dedicated to teaching and researching in the broader field of study. However, before I took the position, I was not specialized in the subfield I teach now. At the moment, my research and publications in field A are split between subfields A1 (in which I pursued research for my MA and PhD) and A2 (my new teaching position). To complicate things, I am in a multidisciplinary department in <em>another</em> field.</p>

<p>There is no available teaching position in my whole field (A) in the whole country in the foreseeable future (say, 10-15 years, unless a miracle happens). I could teach in related fields, and that is what I am doing (and plan to do in better conditions in the not-so-distant future). </p>

<p>The conditions under which I work might be described as both appalling and depressive. I know there are worse conditions in my country; and I know that I earn just as much as anyone else, but that is not the issue. The issue is having no perspective of future research; virtually no intellectual life; almost no contact with other faculty. There is only one room for more than 18 professors in the department; in it there are some 5 computers, 3 of which do not function. The library does not have the books I need for my basic, mandatory course -- in fact, it only has <em>one</em> textbook I use in class! I have to make do with articles and books from the Internet, when and if available. Grants and funding are virtually non-existent. I am in debt because of a conference in which a paper of mine was accepted. After that, I could not attend 3 international conferences because there was no funding.</p>

<p>So, in the end, my question is this: is there any way (attitudes, habits) to make academic life more bearable under these circumstances? Should I give up research and focus on teaching basic subjects, at the risk of fading into oblivion for not publishing? </p>

<p>A note:
I cannot just ""run away"", because, as I said before, there is no way I can find a similar job anywhere. I have been trying to busy my mind with other part-time activities, so as not to worry or stress too much, but that also leaves the feeling that my ""real"" job is useless, or worse: a fake.</p>
