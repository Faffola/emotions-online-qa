As a result, a large number of the department seminars that get hosted are on topics that I have little or no background in and do not relate to my research field in any way.</p>

<p>The expectation seems to be that everyone should go to these type of events to stay abreast of major events and gain some breadth of knowledge, but whenever I go to one that is far outside my sphere of knowledge I end up resenting the wasted time.  To me, it seems like a huge waste to sit through a 60 minute talk on something I don't have the background knowledge necessary to understand in even a rudimentary way.  Sometimes this is the fault of the presenter for not preparing a talk for a broad enough audience, but with biology talks I know that the fault is my own.  Don't ask me the difference between a protein and an amino acid; I have no idea!</p>

50,"<p>Ever since starting graduate school I've tried to make scientific reading a part of my daily ritual; I track pages read using <a href=""https://www.beeminder.com/"">Beeminder</a>, and the graph doesn't lie.  It keeps me honest.</p>

<p>I aim to closely read and summarize 5 pages per day and skim a few other abstracts besides that.  I spend about half my time looking at data and figures which doesn't contribute to my daily ""page count.""  When I'm reading about a new topic these five pages can take several hours, but on topics I have more background in five pages might only take an hour per day.</p>

<p>I guess since everybody defines ""read"" in a different way it's hard to get an objective answer about how much reading is enough.  How much people read seems like a bit of a sensitive topic among real-life colleagues because everyone has a bit of anxiety that they aren't reading enough.  But for those further along in their academic path, I'd like to hear how you approached the literature early in your graduate school career and what you think is a sufficient amount.</p>

<p>I guess this all distills down into two main topics:</p>

<p><strong>When deciding what to read each day, should I focus on depth or breadth?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is five pages of close reading per day enough?</strong>  I know it doesn't sound like much, but it takes significant mental energy to meet that goal.  And consistently reading 5 pages per day adds up to a lot over time.</p>

<p><strong>Edited to add:</strong> I mostly read about petrology, volcanology, structural geology, and tectonics if that makes a difference.  By ""page"" I mean ""page of text"" so if I'm reading a structural geology paper with lots of maps and figures I discount for those and a ""ten page"" paper becomes a 5 page paper for my purposes.</p>

<p>For instance, I've read on some forums (I can't locate the link now) that while considering prospective applications for tenure-track faculty positions, very few Universities accept a candidate who has completed his/her Ph.D from a lower ranked school having a lesser ""brand"" value, irrespective of the fact whether he/she has published equally original work as his/her counterpart from an Ivy league college. How much truth is in this statement? It would be really great if someone already in academia, either as a newly-accepted faculty or someone on the Faculty Hiring committee could share their experiences/statistics on this regard.

<ul>
<li>Past students:
<ol>
<li>Did anyone ever drop out/change advisers midway, and if so, for what reasons? These would be a bit hard to find though, as I don't expect the faculty concerned would list them on their website. It would be great if anyone could let me know how to find out the list of incoming students to a department for any year.</li>
<li>Publication rate, taking into account the venues where they were accepted.</li>
<li>Time taken to graduate - though I accept this is more dependent on the student, a median figure should be telling ...</li>
<li>What they did post Ph.D. - did anyone get tenure if they went into academia, or is almost everyone unable to break out of being a post-doc?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Tenure status: I'm a bit unsure about this, so wanted the community's opinions about it. Just so that I'm clear, I'm only trying to calibrate the applicant's expectations about the working style of his potential adviser - and hence need to know to what extent are the following ""typical"" assumptions valid.</p>

<p><strong>Tenured professor</strong></p>

<p>A full professor is more likely to get grant funding, hence less time spent on TAship - but could also mean less time/effort spent on interactions with students (either being busy with other projects/talks, or due to more commitments to family at that age).</p>

<p><strong>Tenure-track faculty (Assistant profs)</strong></p>

<p>More likely to be young and energetic, and could translate to more time spent on one-to-one discussions with grad students - but funding may prove to be an issue, and may have to be on TA for a longer period.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What other factors would be relevant in this matter, and to what extent am I correct/incorrect in either the factors considered, or for undertaking this exercise at all? </p>

159,"<p>Following on from <a href=""http://academia.stackexchange.com/q/149/96"">What is a &quot;Sandwich thesis&quot;?</a> , is there an easy way to find out which departments at which universities will allow a sandwich thesis (aka a <em>stapler thesis</em>, <em>portfolio thesis</em>, <em>three-paper thesis</em>, <em>thesis by portfolio of publications</em>, <em>thesis by publication</em>, <em>article thesis</em> or <em>compilation thesis</em>)?</p>

<p>That is to say, universities that explicitly allow PhDs theses that consist of a collection of published or in-press articles, possibly topped and tailed by an introduction and summary? It is, to my knowledge, quite rare in the UK - does it perhaps tend to be a country-specific thing?</p>

<p>In most (if not all) PhD programs, incoming grad students are supposed to take relevant courses and fulfill their TA-ship duties (I'm assuming not everyone gets a RA from the 1st semester itself). During that time, they are also expected (and highly encouraged) to keep reading on their chosen research field, to have a concrete idea of where all the focus in that field is at that moment. </p>

the primary qualifications (>90% of fellowships in US require the
applicant to be an US citizen, making it extremely difficult for

306,"<p>I graduated with a Masters of Engineering, concentrating in digital signal processing, in particular medical and audio, almost two years ago. I've always been interested in research, but due to personal circumstances I could never commit a lot of time to working on a research project with a professor, and obviously didn't get a chance to publish anything. Now that I'm more settled and have much more time on my hands, I started getting involved in some open source projects and reading some technical literature (engineering, mathematics) that I couldn't get to before. However, I'd still like to find someone to to collaborate with on a research project who is already established in the field and publishes papers. Part of the reason I want to do that is to be able to eventually apply for a Ph.D. program in a good school, and having publications would be a great thing on my resume.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to find out is how I can work on a research project similar to those graduate students work on as a part of their studies if I'm not a student anymore? Should I contact my old professors from the university? Is it possible to find some ""open research"" team that accepts collaborators from outside? Do I have to do it on my own (quite frankly I'm not sure I can give myself a good enough quick-start)?

I'm an undergraduate chemistry major applying to be a research assistant over the summer. The general process for this is you find a professor doing the type of research you want, and email them your coverletter and CV. If they like you then they either hire you, or apply for a grant to get funding to hire you. Formal or informal interviews can take place at any time during this process, depending on how the professor likes to operate. Formal job descriptions are usually only placed on the grant after the student applies, it isn't listed on the profs website beforehand. Therefore I've applied to several synthetic chemistry groups then been either told I'll be expected to do some modelling as part of my job, or asked if I would be willing to do such research: The second option isn't so bad, but the first is rather awarded to explain, doubly so if I'm not told of this until after the grant is already awarded.</p>

417,"<p>The question is hypothetical, but it came up in a conversation and I'd like to see if we can come up with a logical analysis and conclusion. For various reasons, <em>graduate students</em> might not be inclined to apply for funding. </p>

<p>By <em>funding</em> I mean grants or scholarships intended to support graduate students directly in the form of money given <em>directly</em> to the student. That is, I am <em>not</em> talking about applying for research scholarships intended to fund an experiment, buy equipment, etc. Here are a few (made up) examples.</p>

<p><em><strong>Case 1 (Differential)</strong></em>. I get 20000 of internal departmental funding but be encouraged by the department to apply for external funding. If I then get 5000 scholarship, then the departmental policy might be to drop the internal funding to 15000, so I don't apply for it.</p>

<p><em><strong>Case 2 (Rich Student)</strong></em>. I am very wealthy and I have no need for funding. I am a brilliant student and could probably get many different scholarships but I chose not to because I feel other students with less money need the money more.</p>

<p>The ""Rich Student"" scenario is slightly different than the ""Differential"" scenario. If I am rich then for sure some other poorer student could have gotten the money, whereas in the ""Differential"" scenario, I am now only getting 15000 so another student will get the 5000 anyway.</p>

<p>The problem with not applying for scholarships is that I don't get scholarships, and in many fields winning scholarships is good for your academic career. Perhaps in some fields this is more important than others.</p>

<p>Overwhelmingly I've heard that one should always apply for scholarships regardless of circumstances because of this. Of course theoretically, I could bypass my ""rich student morality"" by using it to do something useful for the community.</p>

<p>Personally, although I am not in these situations, I feel that it is most beneficial to always apply for scholarships, I would just like to have some kind of evidence that support this.</p>

<p><strong>So to put this in a definitive question: for graduate students, is there ever a reason not to apply for at least a few available scholarships?</strong></p>

422,"<p>More than once, I have had (graduate school admissions) orientation sessions where the faculty of the institute introduce their fields, their research and what they expect from potential students (Among other things). </p>

<p>At places I am interested in, this is a useful exercise. However, there are often places which I don't wish to study at but have a few good professors doing some really good work with great knowledge of the field and awesome intuition.</p>

<p><strong>How does one fully exploit an opportunity to interact with good professors from institutes you are not interested in attending?</strong></p>

During my undergraduate years, I did decently on my undergraduate coursework (mostly A-s, some As, a B) but not stellar, and it wasn't until I started taking graduate courses as a senior that I started buckling down and getting solid As or higher. I also had no research experience at this time.</p>

<p>I eventually want to apply to a Ph. D program in pure mathematics. Since I didn't really click until later in undergraduate years, so I was considering applying to 2-year masters programs in mathematics, and then based on my performance there, decide whether I'm fit to work towards a Ph. D. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My question is, what are the advantages and disadvantages to completing a master's program before applying to a separate Ph. D program?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know masters degrees are sometimes considered terminal degrees. Would doing well in masters coursework be advantageous in applying to Ph. D programs later on as opposed to immediately after undergrad years? Does strong performance as a masters student make one a more attractive candidate, or do programs have less interest in applicants who already have a masters? Is it wiser to apply for a Ph. D directly? I'm sorry if this question is considered too much of a soft question. Thank you.</p>

481,"<p>I have a bachelor's degree in computer science. I am looking for an appropriate master program. I am interested in algorithms. </p>

<p>My question is not about where I should continue my education. My question is about how exactly should I search for the place to study for my master's degree. I simply don't know where should I start. I don't know what my first step should be. I don't have any experience living abroad.</p>

<p>Right now in order to choose the place I consider just few parameters.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I am interested in algorithms, almost every university that offers master degree in computer science would be an appropriate choice.</p></li>
<li><p>Fee. It's really a problem. I didn't find universities in Europe that offer master's degree study for free, few of them offer applying for scholarship. But I am not sure I have a good chance to get one, and obviously it doesn't cover all fee. I don't have citizenship in a European country so I assume It's gonna be harder to apply. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>What's your experience? Did you try to apply to scholarship? What's your opinion? Can I start doing research and hope for funds.</p>

<p>In Canada there are few places without fee, therefore it should be very competitive, but at least there is a chance. Usually they ask for GRE in mathematics and computer science; sometimes for IELTS. What's your opinion? I assume you should be really perfect in your field in order to get applied. </p>

<p>In China, very interesting option, without fee or with minimal fee plus one year to get a new language. It looks very attractive, especially with approach of Chinese government to education, as I know there are many programs for free. The only problem is to get the minimal communication in Chinese which may take up to a year according to experience of others. </p>

I have one day off in week for studies. Three years is a long break but I feel the power is back. In my place it's not common that employer will pay for studies, of course I have some savings but this is not going to cover fee, and all spendings for at least two years. </p>

<p>I would like to go to research master. Right now I am not ready to get good grade at GRE, but I am working on it. I am not fluent in English, but in my opinion more important to be good in my field of study. </p>

492,"<p>Tonight I was scrolling through my RSS aggregator (which includes subscriptions for several journals I follow) and <a href=""http://genomebiology.com/2012/13/2/R13/abstract"">this abstract</a> caught my attention. The article's title, as well as the name of the software it describes, includes a subtle reference to <a href=""http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/all-your-base-are-belong-to-us"">this popular internet meme</a>. This gave me a good laugh, and an excuse to watch that ridiculously silly video again.</p>

<p>But on a more serious note, this is not the first time I have seen the use of subtle (or not-so-subtle) humor in the title of a scientific journal article, conference abstract, or poster presentation. Sometimes the humor is even injected into the body of the publication itself. But in general, we as scientists are expected to write in such a way that our findings are easily communicated and easily reproducible. The focus is on clarity, objectivity, and reproducibility.</p>

<p>There are of course no formal rules about the use of humor in scientific literature, but are there any <em>de facto</em> rules? Do these <em>de facto</em> rules depend on the field (computer science vs genetics) or the publisher (Oxford Univ. Press vs BioMed Central) or the journal's impact factor (Nature vs Frontiers in Genetics)? Does humor even have a place in scientific literature, or would we be better off without it?</p>

498,"<p>As a young scholar I frequently struggle with knowing the extent to which I should be critical of particular components of papers I am reviewing. I can formulate a rough hierarchy between major concerns (things that need to be changed or this shouldn't be published) and relatively minor concerns (things I think would improve the manuscript, but aren't substantive enough to affect whether the paper is publishable or not).The question here concerns the latter, in essence I don't know where the cut-off in reasonableness should be for minor concerns.</p>

I'm not sure how to go about this though.</p>

<p>The main problem with me is that I have such a frustratingly common name that <em>a lot</em> of people cannot find me when they google me. So many of them simply don't notice the middle initial that I always use in between my first and last names, and this could actually become a major issue in academia, since people have little time and are prone to giving up quickly if they want to look for me (or for my papers) and can't find me at all (I know this having seen how several academics use the Internet and how they look for people's names). This, in turn, could easily ruin my citation count in the future (it's not just that - it's helpful to others when I have a less common name so that they can more easily locate my stuff). I already know at least several people who specifically told me that they tried to find my email but that they couldn't find it (and this isn't limited to just them - there are many, many more - including long-lost friends who have wanted to talk to me for a long time, but who couldn't find me due to said ultra-common name). Of course, people can go through the respective university directories, but how many people really do that? From my observations (when I've seen people look for someone else), very very few do it. Hell, there are even several people at my OWN university who share the same exact first+last name as me.</p>

<p>In Academia, this is even a bigger problem because the vast majority of your connections will be people who only vaguely recognize/know you, so they may know most of the search clues. Even a ""full name"" + university won't solve all the problems, because I may switch universities and people may only remember the old university that I was in. I'm also very very interdisciplinary, so I want to be searchable to people outside my field as well.</p>

<p>And even if I fix the issue for Google with a massive SEO operation or whatever (that may even be impossible for my ridiculously common name), it's still not going to fix the problem for all of the other ways that people use search.</p>

<p>I'm currently transitioning between undergrad and grad school, so now may be the perfect time for a name change? But I don't know what to do. Is it better for me to change my first name or my last name? The problem is that a citation like ""Chen 2011"" is going to produce so many entries that <em>no one</em> will ever find them, even though they frequently do google things like that (and I simply cannot prevent people from googling something like that). Chen is so frustratingly common that even a ""Chen and Name2 2011"" paper could come from some random medical paper rather than from something I wrote.</p>

<p>As an additional complication, the % of Chinese people using the English Internet is exponentially rising, and I can only expect the problem to get worse in the future because of that (and not just for my first name, but even variants of my first name too).</p>

625,"<p>A question I have been wondering for a while is if there exists an actual proof that a blind reviewing process (i.e. where the reviewers are anonymous, and the reviews not published) is better than an open one (i.e. where the reviewers are not anonymous and/or the reviews are published along with the accepted papers). </p>

<p>Basically, whenever I question the fact that having a blind reviewing process does not guarantee any quality (which, somehow, usually coincides with receiving a poor review for a paper ...), I'm told that anonymity is crucial for the reviewing process. But is there any proof of that? I don't believe there exists any perfect system, but I'm just not sure why does the blind (or even double-blind) one is considered as the best (or the ""least worst""). </p>

<p>However, my question does not concern the reviews I receive for the papers I submit, but concerns the reviews I write for papers I have been assigned. Since the whole process is done under confidentiality, it is not clear who owns the copyright on a review I wrote, and what does the review include. </p>

<p>For instance, let us assume that X is member of a PC of a conference Y, and assigns to me a review of a paper Z, written by A and B (assuming it's not a double-blind). Can I publish on my blog: ""Here is my review for Y, asked by X, on the paper Z, written by A and B""? </p>

<p>I think that there are two points here: </p>

<ol>
<li>Is it legal? (for instance, publishing the camera-ready version of a paper might be illegal due to the copyright transfer, would it be also the care here?). </li>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> There is been several comments/answer wondering <strong>why</strong> I would like to publish a review I wrote. To give a bit of background of this question, I believe that the current reviewing system, created when the academic community was small and there was no Internet (i.e. no easy access to information), might not be the best, although clearly working. This is for me a very interesting debate, but somehow out of the scope the Q&amp;A format of Academia SE, which is why I tried to focus on my question on whether it was possible to do so, not if it was the best thing to do in the current system (and just to be clear, I don't plan to do it, but I just like to know what are my options). Anyway, thanks for the answers bringing a different light on this debate. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> After seeing the update in Jeff's answer, I just realised that I didn't make it explicit that I was talking about reviews <em>after</em> the reviewing process. Jeff says that it's ok if the paper is accepted, and although I clearly understand the argument of <em>why</em> I shouldn't publish a review of a rejected paper, the question still holds: by publishing a review of a rejected paper, I publish the information that these authors submitted this paper to this conf/journal, which is supposed to be confidential between the authors and the editors. Would I break any rule by doing so?   </p>

661,"<p><sup>This question was written by a friend of mine. I'm helping them by posting it here, with permission.</sup></p>

<p>How should I use the name-year referencing system (loosely speaking, the Harvard system) in such cases where there are multiple works that have the same first author but a different set of coauthors?</p>

<p>In such cases where the maximum number of authors among all articles sharing the same first author is not more than three, or perhaps four, the solution is very simple. Just mention them all inline and use the reference list as usual. E.g. the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""... the complex formation was observed by Miller and Nelson (1991)""<br>
  ""... cf. Miller, Nelson and Byrne (1993)""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, if there are more authors in any of the articles, this gets quite tricky, since listing a huge number of authors inline is definitely not an option to me. I'd rather change to number references.</p>

<p>Now, making the references unambiguous is not a problem. For instance, the following references could be addressed to inline as ""Barton et al."" without in any way losing the one-to-one relation between inline citations and reference list entries. That is, the articles are differentiated, as the other is ""Barton et al. (1980)"" and the other ""Barton et al. (1985)"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Barton, D. H. R.; Crich, D.; Potier, P. (1985). ""On the mechanism of the decarboxylative rearrangement of thiohydroxamic esters"". Tetrahedron Lett. 26, 5943.</p>
  
  <p>Barton, D. H. R.; Dowlatshahi, H. A.; Motherwell, W. B.; Villemin, D. V. (1980). ""A New Radical Decarboxylation Reaction for the Conversion of Carboxylic Acids into Hydrocarbons"". J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun., p. 732.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What really <em>is</em> the problem is the alphabetical order in which the references should be sorted in the reference list. If the articles listed above are referred to just as ""Barton et al."", the reader does not know the exact position in the reference list where to find the articles.</p>

<p>One solution might be just ignoring this slight complication.</p>

<p>Other solution is to use ""et al"" in the reference list, too, if absolutely necessary. Thus, in the example above, the first article would be referred to as ""Barton, Crich and Potier (1985)"" inline, and the latter as ""Barton et al. (1980)"".</p>

<p>In the reference list, they would be expressed <em>and arranged</em> according to the inline cites:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Barton, D. H. R.; Crich, D.; Potier, P. (1985). ""On the mechanism of the decarboxylative rearrangement of thiohydroxamic esters"". Tetrahedron Lett. 26, 5943.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Any other recommendations?</p>

<p>Please don't suggest Google, since I did not find an answer after 30 minutes of search. There are perhaps hundreds of ""Harvard citation guides"" available, but I found none that addressed this problem.</p>

670,"<p>I am an M.Sc. student in mathematics. I was recently invited by some Ph.D. students and Post-Docs (a group of 5 people, including myself) to join their study group. We are reading a specific text, which should get us ready to read some more advanced work. This work is relevant to the research of some of the other people in the group, but my main goal is to experience this learning methodology with the added advantage of getting to know a few aesthetic results in mathematics.</p>

<p>We met around 6 times, and it is not what I'm used to from courses in the sense that we don't completely understand all the details. Nevertheless, we go on reading.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We encounter a definition and we can't find out its exact meaning. In this case we usually know of an example of a mathematical object satisfying this definition (because it's mentioned in the text) and we just try to see how the propositions in the text apply to the specific example.</p></li>
<li><p>A proof is given with very few details - we manage to fill in some of the gaps, but not all of them, so we just take an example again and simply accept the statement of the theorem so we can use it later.</p></li>
<li><p>An excercise is given in the text and we only solve part of it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We allow ourselves to skip some details because this text is only meant to get us ready for some more advanced, but more specific, material. My question is how we can find out whether or not we are gaining anything, and how we can gain more given the fact that we are all busy and don't want to invest much more time in this specific reading (we have a 3 hours meeting every week).</p>

<p>I have a feeling that I'm ""getting used"" to some ideas and facts while reading this text (in contrast with ""completely understanding""), but I'm not sure if I'm really gaining anything or whether it's just an illusion and I'm not sure how to test my gain of knowledge. The exercises in the text allow us to test our understanding of the details, but not of the general ideas.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I will clarify what the question is, in response to aeismail's comment:</p>

<p>As Charles and Nunoxic say, the question of whether shallow-reading is useful is separate from the fact that we are studying in a group. So, the 2 separate questions are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>When reading without understanding all the details, how can I find out whether or not I'm gaining anything?</p></li>
  <li><p>How can we make the process of studying in a group for 3 hours a week most efficient?</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>These 2 may have better been asked as 2 separate questions, but I did not  notice that (in my mind they were related because the group study was the first time I encountered shallow-reading).
To summarize the answers I got so far:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>It <strong>is</strong> possible, for some people, to gain knowledge from shallow-reading and one way to test it is to see if you understand <strong>why</strong> each topic is being developed and <strong>why</strong> the text is structured the way it is.</p></li>
  <li><p>When studying in a group, one should test his ability to work out the details himself after the group sessions.</p></li>
  </ol>

So I figured the Academia forum was the best place to ask, but feel free to point me to another direction. That said, this question is more about getting inspiration, rather than getting answers.</p>

<p>Here's my story: I'm currently studying computer science at college, and finally being top of my class in a particular course has given me the confidence to strive for greater things than I originally thought possible for myself. I want to pursue a job in research, because I would rather help mankind with technological/innovative progress than financial/social progress... So my dream is to acquire myself a well-earned Ph.D.</p>

<p>But here's the thing: I've studied computer security most of my life (leisure-study), and always imagined that this would be my main field of research because I'm very good at this specific area of expertise.</p>

<p>However, recently i've started to rethink this career path. My realization was that this field, albeit obviously not wasteful, was not going to prove beneficial for mankind in general/long-term. Unless we could use these defensive information technologies against a synthetic alien invasion, who's <em>plan A</em> was to destroy our Internet, hindering communications. But somehow I still think they would succeed.</p>

<p>So I have started to look into other areas of computer science. I kinda always had a dream of working with quantum computers (probably more a physics/engineering field at the moment), but i'm not really one of those extremely hardcore nerd types (God bless you guys.), so I suppose that's out of reach for me.</p>

<p>I'm leaning towards artificial intelligence, because I imagine that the two most prominent areas of research that will cause significiant improvements on our way of life will be either quantum computers, for their theoretical astonomical computational powers, and self-aware ""strong AIs"" that can help our race with all our physical, philosophical and economical problems (to name a few).</p>

<p>But I would still like to know if you guys think I should try to pursue something different. I'm not all that great at mathematics, but i'm extremely committed to my work once I begin, so I wouldn't mind becoming one of those ""hardcore nerd types"". I looked abit on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science</a> , and skimmed the theoretical computer science section, but nothing really sticks.</p>

<p>P.S. Please do not provide an answer such as ""just learn what you love to learn"", but it's not that simple in this case. I love just about everything that has to do with computers, both theory and applied, and computer science isn't a small genre to pick from.</p>

My ideal tool would be some tool where I could put the bibtex (one for each publication) and the pdf, and that would create a kind of database, such that I could sort my publications easily. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why don't people publish failures? I mean, if they tried some experiment and realized at the end that they tried everything and nothing worked. Why don't they publish this? Is it because such content won't get published or is it because it is shameful to have a failed experiment in a journal alongside prize-winning papers?</p></li>

Now that I re-read the papers, I realize that I can say (with much confidence) that the author is hiding something. For instance, one of the authors who was comparing two systems, gave an excellent theoretical foundation but when he tried to validate the theory with experiments, there were horrible discrepancies in the experiments (which I now realize). If the theory wasn't satisfied by the experiments, why not publish that (clearly pointing out parts of the theory which worked and which didn't) and save the future researchers some time? If not in a journal, why not ArXiv or their own websites?</p></li>

768,"<p>Background: I have the opportunity to pursue a Computer Science graduate degree at a well respected program (around top 20). I spoke with the professors at the university and I feel like I am a good fit with their research program. My ultimate pursuits are to complete a PhD in CS. I've done research as an undergraduate and it has only confirmed my notion that I want to pursue a research track career.</p>

<p>More background: I applied to jobs (in case I was rejected to all the programs I applied for) prior to hearing back from my respective graduate programs. I accepted a position for an industry job (this was to secure I wouldn't be both unemployed &amp; not in school).</p>

<p>Dilemma: Turns out my top graduate school is very interested in me, and I'm very interested in them. I would rather go to graduate school than work in industry forever. The industry job pays very well. I am split between A) working for a maximum of 1 year(It would only be 1 year, seriously I do not care about the money enough to work past a year) and B) going straight to graduate school. </p>

<p>My concerns are as follows, if I choose A): </p>

<ul>
<li>Could I potentially defer my admissions?</li>
<li>If I am not allowed to defer my admissions, would I have a good chance of re-applying and being accepted a year later?</li>
<li>Would my potential advisers look <em>down</em> on me for deciding to work a year?</li>
</ul>

<p>I already made my mind up it would be a 1 year gig if I decide A). I know some people say once you make money, you may not be able to readjust to the graduate salary pay. But I don't think that will apply to because I'm going to live very frugally with or without industry pay.</p>

778,"<p>I am most of the way through my freshman year at Washington State University, pursuing a BS in  Computer Science. Going away to school has been rough, and I have been pretty depressed for most of the time there. Right now, I am leaning towards not wanting to continue my education, but my parents are strongly opposed.</p>

<h2>Why I don't think I need college</h2>

<p>One of the main factors that is pushing me away from school is the fact that I already spend plenty of time working on my own software projects. On my own, I have gained extensive knowledge and experience with web application development, using platforms that are far too new to have a undergraduate class that teaches them. These are platforms used in real workplaces and production software, and I would not gain these skills in school.</p>

<p>Second, I have lost a lot of faith in my school after seeing so much incompetency from people who are meant to be educating me. The professors outsource a majority of their work to their TA's, who I feel I know more than. My Computer Science class is really just an entourage of TA's parroting the words of the professor, with embarrassingly little of their own understanding.</p>

<p>Another big reason is that for 10 weeks this summer, I will be travelling to Silicon Valley to take part in a 'startup accelerator program'. This is a program where already-established tech entrepreneurs and investors help people who are new to the game with building their product and starting their company. At the end of the 10 weeks, investors decide how much they want to put into each company, in exchange for some equity. Of the companies that go through these kinds of programs, a very high amount succeed. I feel that if the developers I am working with and I do well here (no, it is not guaranteed that we will make money), college is pointless for me.</p>

<h2>What college is like for me now</h2>

<p>College has been hard for me. Not because I am not capable of understanding the material, and not because I don't have enough time to get all my work done. I have been suffering in my classes because instead of going to class or finishing assignments, I work on my own projects.</p>

<p>Of course, if I forced myself to put time and effort into this work, I would achieve satisfactorily. However, that is much easier said than done.</p>

<p>In order to start caring about school, I would need to drop all my other software side-projects (or at least greatly limit the time I spend on them). Essentially, this is a choice, and right now I will always pick my own projects over school.</p>

<h2>Do I really need school?</h2>

<p>After all that I have seen about the limited job market (even for degree-holders) and all that I have experienced in school, I am really questioning whether I need to stay in school. Convince me whether or not I really need a BS, or any other advice you can give about the subject.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read and answer this. I normally feel bad taking time away from other people for my own benefit, but this is a major life-decision, and I cannot properly come to consensus on my own.</p>

I have been working non-stop to make sure I perform in my courses, undergraduate research, etc. and I am just wondering if there is any way to learn about these topics at a slower pace or just have more time to think about the topics eventually. I understand I will have to at least get through graduate school and get a PhD (otherwise there would be a chance I'd turn out as a crackpot), but I'm just really tired of having so much information crammed into me without having the time to think about what I am learning. I want to do my own additional research on topics I see connections between, and think more about the big picture of how the different fields of Pure Mathematics and Theoretical Physics are related. There are so many unfinished papers that I have started throughout my undergraduate on embeddings of low-dimensional manifolds, determining knot invariants by unique methods, etc. but I just have no time to think about what I want to think about when there's that Real Analysis assignment due the day after my midterm in E&amp;M which I had to stay up all night studying for because I had three quizzes the previous week in blah blah blah blah... for years on end.</p>

<p>Essentially, my question is this: <strong>Is there any other way that someone (after getting a PhD or a few post-docs) can do research at their own pace and just completely go after their interests without having to justify what they are doing to funding agencies, being swamped with administrative work (such as marking exams and writing grants), etc.?</strong> </p>

<p>I know that is asking a lot out for a life style, but I would even be interested in leaving academia altogether to just do my own independent study somewhere and travel around to different universities to collaborate whenever I have new findings or need some new inspiration or ideas. Are there any easy part-time jobs one could do to support such a lifestyle? Julian Barbour would be someone who I look up to in that respect, I believe he did this exact thing by making a living translating Russian academic papers into English.</p>

<p>Any comments, helpful suggestions, about how it would be possible to live an non-traditional academic lifestyle where people still take you to be credible and you can publish your work in journals. I just want to avoid working working working my entire life without a chance to reflect and then just die.</p>

866,"<p>A doctorate involves plumbing the depths of a problem and often this involves a lot of knowledge breadth-wise in related areas. Though the latter is provided by coursework, education about a precise ""tool"" that a doctorate may need during solving his problem is unlikely to have been provided by the courses. Often the PhD may run into huge tomes of material which he has been introduced to by Wikipedia. Intuitively he/she may feel that somewhere in those volumes lies a theorem or an idea which can provide vital keys to solving his own problem. So I come to my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What should a student do to get the best out of a book-reading exercise? The question in turn assumes the student has arrived by some means at the best book for serving his purpose.</li>
<li>There is a trade-off involved in reading books tangential to your field: you may spend a lot of time groping in the dark looking for a bounty which may never be there. How does one gauge the potential applicability of a book to his work? When does a student decide to pull the plug on such an effort?</li>

870,"<p>After some bad experiences in a master's program, I decided to become a PhD student in the same program. My plan was to finish a paper and leave as soon as possible, meanwhile earning the recommendations that my bad early experiences prevented. That's basically been the situation for a couple years now - longer than I ever expected. At this point, I'm finally finish my projects and I've presented at a couple conferences. I genuinely like the professor I'm working with now. However, I never intended to specialize in this research area; the idea of doing my PhD in this area is very disappointing to me. And (selfishly?), I very much want to move to a new institution. </p>

<p>At this point, I'm not sure what to do. My ideal situation would be to finish my current projects and move to a new institution to work in a field I was more excited about.

I'm also concerned that leaving now will look strange on a graduate application: why admit a quitter? I'm also starting to feel a little old to be starting a new program.</p>

918,"<p>I am currently a graduate student, who will (hopefully!) graduate in the next year (or two . . .).  I have slowly come to realize that I enjoy teaching, and consequently want to do more of it!  My main reasons are:</p>

<ul>
<li>to gain experience</li>
<li>to bolster my CV</li>
<li>to learn to be a better teacher</li>
</ul>

<p>That last point is particularly important to me, because I feel I have received insufficient training in how to teach mathematics well.</p>

<p>Now, I have done the usual TA thing.  For the past year, I have also been an adjunct instructor at a local four-year college, so I pretty much know what it's like to be ""fully responsible"" for a course.  What I am looking for are challenging opportunities which allow me to do some–or all–of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>teach fairly sophisticated math to bright high school students / undergraduates</li>
<li>engage them in innovative thinking/research</li>
<li>be consistently mentored/evaluated throughout the duration of this experience</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, the last point is rather important to me.  So my question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do such programs exist?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am sure they do, but when Googling, I invariably come up with graduate summer schools, or ""local"" opportunities. (By ""local"" here, I mean those which are only eligible to students in that particular school's graduate program.) So I am hoping someone (or several people) here know more about it than Google does.</p>

<p>I know that most opportunities for this summer have probably already expired, but I want to stress I am not only focused on summer sessions.  In particular, I would gladly forego my usual TA appointment for a semester, to be a part of a more difficult and rewarding experience somewhere else.</p>

997,"<p>My questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Are there universites offering a B.Sc. in computer science aimed solely at giving the best training to future theoretical computer science researchers?<br>
  (in the universities I checked, the programs are a combination of training people for research and training people to be programmers in the industry).</li>
  <li>As it seems not to be the case in most universities, is there a reason not to offer such programs? (financial maybe)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The motivation for the questions:</p>

<p>I am a mathematics M.Sc. student.
I had several conversations with researchers (full/associate professors) in theoretical computer science when I was looking for a thesis advisor. Three of them mentioned to me that they wish they would have learnt more mathematics in their basic training (two of them had a B.Sc. in mathematics and computer science and said they wished they did an M.Sc. in mathematics as well and one of them studied computer science only for a B.Sc.).
Their comments referred to funtional analysis (by a researcher in metric embeddings), to group theoretic constructions of expander graphs, etc.</p>

<p>This led me to check the program in computer science and here is what I found:</p>

<p>If a student really tries to get as much cs-theory and mathmematics in his B.Sc, he can study: 38% theoretical computer science, 40% mathematics with mathematics students, 6% mathematics with cs-students only, 16% technical courses. This amounts to 16% waste of time (for a future theoertical cs researchers) and 6% non-optimal use of time (as these math courses with cs-students feel a bit like high-school math).</p>

<p>I included the basic programming courses under theoretical cs because I believe they are essential in order to ""know what you're talking about"" when studying algorithms, computability, etc.
The situation is even a little worse from the perspective of this student because I included all the graduate courses in theoretical cs offered to undergrads, so he will have less theoretical cs courses to take during the M.Sc.</p>

<p>It seems like a much better choice for a future cs theory researcher is to study mathematics and take the cs theory courses (together with the most basic programming courses) as the ""free choice"" courses. I feel lucky to have done that as it seems that I would not have received such an excellent training if I had gone for the university's fixed cs+math program.</p>

<p>I think that the cs world could benefit alot if universities offered both B.Sc. and M.Sc. programs in ""mathematics and theoretical computer science"". This can be good both in giving a better training and in encouraging future colloboration.</p>

<p>So here's another question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you agree that such programs (""mathematics and theoretical computer science"") are a better alternative to cs-only programs or math+cs program which include many technical courses, as far as future theoretical cs researchers are concerned?</p>

1004,"<p>I would be interested in creating with some colleagues a <a href=""http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/fet-open/ye_en.html"">FET Young Explorers</a> project, in which I would be Work Package leader. 
I've been involved in several european projects, but always as a postdoc recruited by a PI (or WP leader), and I don't have a permanent position yet. So basically, the idea of applying to this project would be to get my full salary paid by the EU project, but I don't know if it's possible. </p>

<p>Indeed, in the FAQ, they say that the applicants need to have a position somewhere. I don't think getting a position would be a problem, but only if I come with my own salary. The question in this case is whether the hosting institution still needs to pay some part of my salary? </p>

<p>EDIT: A precision on the question. From the <a href=""ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/fp7/docs/calls/cooperation/ict/c-gfastrep-201103_en.pdf"">Guide for Applicants</a>, Section A3/Budget, p. 47, the part about the requested European Commission contribution:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The requested EC contribution shall be determined by applying the upper funding limits indicated below, per activity and per participant to the costs accepted by the Commission, or to the flat rates or lump sums.
  Maximum reimbursement rates of eligible costs</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Research and technological development = 50% or 75%*</li>
  <li>Demonstration activities = 50%</li>
  <li>Other activities (including management) = 100%</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>(*) For participants that are non profit public bodies, secondary and higher education establishments, research organisations and SMEs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if the salary of a researcher is included in the Research and Technological development, then does that mean that it's possible to only ask for 75% of it to the EC? (assuming the researcher is employed by a university). </p>

1006,"<p>Most universities (at least in North America) have the concept of ""Qualification Exams"" taken one year after the student joins the graduate course. These usually encompass all that was done in the first year and as undergraduate and might also test some other (research abilities) of the student by asking him to present papers (s)he found interesting.</p>

<p>Some universities treat this as a formality and everyone who attempts usually gets through while some universities take quals very seriously and won't allow the student to continue if he fails the quals (maybe, they will allow for 2nd attempt). These universities might subscribe reading lists consisting of textbooks and papers which comprises of ""must-have"" knowledge of the field. The latter might constitute as a difficult phase for students who find themselves ill prepared in a certain portion of the exam.

As a compromise I'm thinking to put the previous employer in the affiliation, and the name of my new employer in the footnote, something like ""currently at XYZ"". Surely I'll discuss this issue with both, although the opinion of the community is also very valuable.</p>

1082,"<p>My background:  I'm currently 1 year out of my undergrad in psychology and I currently have a job working on a educational grant project at a university.  I've lost some interest in the field of psychology as a whole and I'm considering going back to school for computer science.  When I expressed this interest to an adviser at my old school she mentioned that I might be interested in a post bachelor comp sci certificate.  The certificate is 30 credits and can probably be done in about half the time that another bachelors could be completed in.  I asked her if any of the graduates of the certificate program had had any trouble getting into graduate school with said degree and she said no.  However, I believe there is probably more to this than she let on considering that it is her job to promote this program.</p>

<p>Question:  I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with these type of certificates?  I know that I will have a more complete computer science education with an undergrad but I'm wondering if it is completely necessary.  All said and done I would like to get a masters in computer science because it seems like the smart career move.  Will I be limiting my job potential by only having a certificate and a bachelors in an unrelated field?  Is graduate school really possible with just a certificate?  My dream job would be working for a company in research and development for human to computer interfaces.  I also have a fleeting passion for gaming and music production, but I consider these to be more hobbies than serious career interests.</p>

1118,"<p>I have a master's degree in Computer Science. I have applied to PhD programs, and decisions are trickling in. I may soon have to choose between two or more PhD programs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have diverse interests. I was advised that a successful PhD application is usually quite specific, so I made each of my applications very specific. I wrote to a professor working in decision making (AI), another working in computational learning theory, another working in computer music, another working in quantum &amp; parallel computing, another working in logical foundations &amp; philosophy of computation. With much enthusiasm, I informed each professor that I was interested in pursuing a PhD in his / her field. This is <strong>true</strong>. I am interested in <strong>each</strong> of these fields, and know something about each of them. When advised to apply, I did.</p>

<p>The problem is - being interested in each of these fields also means that I'm interested in <strong>all</strong> of them. (There are <strong>more</strong> areas of CS I'm interested in. What's worse - my interests are not even restricted to CS. For the purposes of this post, I'm restricting myself to only the mentioned areas.) So when I choose between PhD programs, I'm choosing between completely different areas - and that is surely going to be excruciating.</p>

<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a case of not knowing my 'true interest' now, only to discover it later. I have <strong>no</strong> 'true interest'. I have always pursued numerous unrelated things in parallel. I love all my interests equally. In fact, I love the feeling of 'being interested' more than the interests themselves. Whenever I've tried to restrict myself to <strong>one</strong> topic of study - even for a month - that feeling is lost, and I am quickly bored. As a result, my skill-set is a classic case of a jack of all trades - master of none. The worst part is - everybody knows that a PhD is about getting deep into <strong>one</strong> specific topic. It's not about breadth - it's about depth. Even if I were to choose one of the PhD programs (and I <strong>must</strong> choose one), I have a feeling that I might get bored quickly and be prone to constant topic-changing / transferring. Again, this is not about being fickle - it's about following my heart, and my heart takes me to different things at different times.</p>

<p>Do you think I'm likely to fail / never complete my PhD? Does anyone have any advice about dealing with diverse interests? Has anyone felt the same way and dealt with it? I'd love to hear from you.</p>

1199,"<p>I know it's rather difficult to establish a ranking of publications, especially because the ones in charge of establishing values for venues might be biased by their field, and several other aspects. However, I know some well-accepted (at least locally) ranking, that consider all fields under research, e.g. <a href=""http://qualis.capes.gov.br/webqualis/"">Brazilian Qualis</a> - in portuguese - that includes both confs and journals, and <a href=""http://www.arc.gov.au/era/default.htm"">Australian ERA</a> - this latter has served as baseline for some class A conferences in Computer Science (my research field), in some countries other than Australia. </p>

<p>Hence, I wonder about the existence of another ""global ranking"", that has been applied overseas, thus including at least the most prominent events and journals in every field. For journals, it's a little bit easier to measure its importance, by looking at their Impact Factor values, but for conferences it's a little bit tough. To the best of my knowledge, I don't know a largely-applied means of measuring the impact of a conf.</p>

1206,"<h3>General background</h3>

<p>Some time ago, I was reading <a href=""http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/06/23/write-only-articles/"">a blog post, where there was some discussion about how many people read journal articles</a>.
I think that such an estimate is important when trying to assess the impact of research on society.
However, whereas internet sites readily track usage. Such information seems a little more difficult to come by when it comes to readership for a particular journal article.</p>

<h3>Initial Ideas</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Articles vary</strong>: Obviously journal articles vary in many ways and just as with citation counts, readership is likely to be highly skewed, perhaps something like a power function. In addition to academic impact, presumably articles that are available for free on the internet are read more.</li>
<li><strong>Time since publication</strong>: The number of reads increases over time, but the rate of readership presumably varies over time (perhaps a spike on initial release, and then gradual decline as relevance dissipates).</li>
<li><strong>Definitions of reading vary</strong>: Read counts would also increase or decrease based on how reading is defined. At the low end is a glance at an abstract. At the high end is carefully reading the entire article. I'd be happy with a working definition that involved reading at least two pages.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Initial Data</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.plosone.org/static/journalStatistics.action#PLoSONE"">PlosOne article statistics</a>: As a very rough guide, it suggests that mean views per article is around 800 per year.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.journalofvision.org/content/9/4/i?related-urls=yes&amp;legid=jov;9/4/i"">Journal of Vision</a>: this article reports some download statistics: ""In the most recent accounting in July, 2008, the top five articles were each downloaded between 1,993 and 3,478 times.""</li>
<li>Some journals list subscription counts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Initial Guess</h3>

<p>I find it useful to have a ball park estimate of these things.
My own initial guess, based on minimal data, is that readership is between 50 and 1000 times the citation count for the article. Linking the estimate to citation count makes it easier to estimate for a given article and should incorporate effects like time and journal prestige.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<ul>
<li>What is a good estimate of how many people read a given journal article?</li>
<li>What data and sources of information justify this estimate?</li>
<li>Is there any established literature that can inform such an estimate?</li>
</ul>

1208,"<p>I have recently applied to two PhD programs (in Europe) under professors working in the area of Sound and Music Computing (SMC). Both programs are very well regarded in this area.</p>

<p>SMC covers topics such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Music information retrieval</li>
<li>Computational musicology</li>
<li>Algorithmic composition / performance</li>
<li>Sentiment and expression modelling in music</li>
<li>Computational approaches to music cognition</li>
<li>Audio signal processing</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a complete list. I find the field very interesting.</p>

<p>However, would the industry want to hire someone with a PhD in SMC? Let's say Google (just as an example), which is known to hire many PhDs. Would they be interested in someone with a PhD in SMC, or would they restrict themselves to machine learning / web / search PhDs? And yes... I'm sure that Yamaha would love to hire an SMC PhD, but would I be restricting my options to only a small subset of the industry?</p>

<p>What about academia? How would they look upon an applicant to the assistant professor position who has a PhD in this area? Would they simply reject him saying ""Sorry, but we don't do research in your area..."", since it is true that <strong>most</strong> CS departments don't do active research in SMC? Again, would I be restricting my options to only a small subset of universities?</p>

<p>Secondly, how easy / hard is it to switch fields AFTER doing a PhD in it? I may like SMC enough to work on it for 5 years (and get a PhD) but I MAY not want to work on it for a lifetime. In industry or academia, could I switch to something else when (and if) I want to?</p>

<p>One researcher told me that I should only consider pursuing my interest in SMC <strong>after</strong> I have already established myself in some other, more fundamental, area of CS, like algorithms or AI. Do you agree?</p>

<p>This thread should be useful to anyone considering a PhD in a specialized or maybe even an obscure area.</p>

1228,"<p>I am an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at the University of Florida. In response to recent budget cuts to higher education in Florida, my department (Computer and Information Sciences and Engineering, CISE) could be undergoing some restructuring, namely the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>All of the Computer Engineering Degree programs, BS, MS and PhD, would be moved from the Computer &amp; Information Science and Engineering Dept. to the Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept. along with most of the advising staff.</li>
<li>Roughly half of the faculty would be offered the opportunity to move to Electrical/Computer Eng. (ECE), Biomedical Eng. (BME), or Industrial/Systems Eng. (ISE).</li>
<li>Staff positions in CISE which are currently supporting research and graduate programs would be eliminated.</li>
<li>The activities currently covered by TAs would be reassigned to faculty and the TA budget for CISE would be eliminated.</li>
<li>Any faculty member who wishes to stay in CISE may do so, but with a revised assignment focused on teaching and advising.</li>
</ul>

<p>(<a href=""http://saveufcise.wordpress.com/"">click here for additional information</a>)</p>

<p>The Dean of our college claims that eliminating research and TA support within the CISE department will have no effect on the quality of the education future students will receive. She also claims that existing research in the department will be unaffected, except that it will be moved to ECE, BME, or ISE.</p>

<p>As an undergrad, I don't feel qualified to challenge these claims. Therefore, I would like to hear your opinions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Will the quality of education in the CISE department be the same after this restructuring?</li>
<li>Can software-oriented research take place in a department which, until now, has concentrated solely on hardware/electronics?</li>
<li>Since only half of the faculty will be moved to a research department, half must remain in CISE and focus solely on teaching (with no TA support). Do you think these professors will remain at UF given the circumstances?</li>
<li>Will the teaching-only CISE department be able to attract quality professors? Top students?</li>
<li>Will employers value a UF CISE degree as much as they do now? [thanks for pointing this one out JeffE]</li>

That is, everyone submits their papers in advance and the assumption is that conference goers who come to a given talk have read the paper in advance. In principle this seems ideal, we can use that face-to-face time to discuss work instead of just listening to people read their papers (this people reading their paper at a conference thing happens all the time in the humanities). In what circumstances should conferences precirculate papers? Is it something that is best for small conferences, or are there good examples of large conferences that work this way too?</p>

<h3>Background:</h3>

<p>When hearing about development or history of science, the phrase 'widely accepted' is quite popular. One of the common stories seems to be of some discovery which nobody wanted to believe when published, but a decade or a few later the scientific world came to accept it and it turned into consensus. Prime examples in history would be the heliocentric world view or the theory of evolution.</p>

<p>More recently, I have read 'The Selfish Gene' by Richard Dawkins. He takes every chance to provide evidence that the theory of group selection is unnecessary to explain evolution. The book was published in 1976, when group selection was apparently quite popular. In annotations of the current edition, he gives comments about how the scientific world has now more accepted that group selection is wrong. I asked a question about one of his claims which I did not fully understand (irrelevant here) on Biology.SE and - unexpectedly - promptly got answers by people claiming that group selection was presently very widely accepted.</p>

<p>When is one option better than the other if you have the choice between doing your research in an academic or non-academic setting?</p>

<p>A few potential advantages I can think of:</p>

<ul>
<li>You're likely to be hired by the lab after graduation. If you don't want to enter academia and are happy with the lab, this could be your career. If you do want to enter academia, often you're in good company because leaving research labs for academia isn't uncommon.</li>
<li>You can work with more people (your school's students and professors and the lab's researchers). This'll expand your professional network and expose you to different perspectives.</li>
<li>Your affiliation with the lab could add some credibility to you and your research.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few potential disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Travel could be problematic if your school and your lab aren't close. This could be mitigated by taking care of the coursework first.</li>
<li>The research topic is often dictated by someone in the lab if you are funded by them. If you decide this topic is not worth researching or not interesting then you might have a problem. Politics in the lab could change the research topic in the future and that might also be a problem.</li>

They instead prefer having a webpage and providing a URL. This is tough, as students (esp. undergrads) do not have a lot to share on a website. Moreover there is a contradiction: if a professor cannot view a résumé in her browser, what is the guarantee she would visit a website and click each of the sublinks?

1482,"<p><strong>Background</strong>
I am asking this question in the context of the long running plagiarism scandal in Germany.The most prominent victim of the scandal of plagiarized doctoral dissertations by politicians was former defense minister <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Theodor_zu_Guttenberg#Doctorate_plagiarism"">Guttenberg</a>. His doctoral title was withdrawn, and he resigned from his position. He was followed by several other politicians, and now even the German Education and Research Minister Annette Schavan is under <a href=""http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/05/german-research-minister-faces.html?ref=ra"">suspicion of plagiarism</a>.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is that for all these people, the plagiarism was detected only due to plagiarism detection wikis like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VroniPlag_Wiki"">VroniPlag</a> and GuttenPlag, where ordinary people compared these doctoral dissertations with other published work. The only role of universities has been to respond to allegations that are especially well documented and have caused a reasonable amount of public uproar.</p>

<p>Don't the Universities themselves bear any responsibility for letting this plagiarism go undetected? In fact Guttenberg's dissertation was awarded a <em>summa cum laude</em>. It appears as if their is no mechanism whatsoever (at least in German universities) to detect academic fraud.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any mechanism at all to detect plagiarism or fraudulent research in PhD dissertations (doctoral theses)?</strong></p>

<p>I understand that there are probably country based differences and my experience is primarily with the German system. Still it would be good to know the seriousness with which academic fraud is taken in different countries. This appears especially pertinent to the maintenance of the credibility of academia in general and doctoral degrees in particular, and yet there seem to be no checks whatsoever!</p>

<p>I like the idea of writing an academic book.</p>

<ul>
<li>It currently looks better on a CV when applying for jobs, grants, promotions, etc. than a blog post, or a website.</li>
<li>Libraries and people archive the work</li>
<li>Most of the best academic content currently seems to end up in books and journal articles, rather than on websites.</li>
<li>People have an attractive physical copy to engage with if they want.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I don't like the constraints imposed by a book. In particular, readership is limited to those who buy/borrow the book or have access to a library.</p>

<h3>Aim</h3>

<p>In some cases, I'd prefer to write something like an ""open access book"". </p>

<li>However, access to a PDF of the book is free online. </li>
<li>The book gets an ISBN, archiving, availability on Amazon, etc. and all the academic recognition associated with publishing an academic book.</li>

1915,"<p>I have a few questions regarding admission into a PhD program in Applied Linguistics or Linguistics at US universities. I could not find any other valuable online sources regarding Linguistics for the answers I seek. Let me start with my qualification. I am a female international student with a Masters in English Linguistics and Literature with a percentage of 65.9. Although its the best language university in my country but it is not that famous anywhere else. My grade average was B with no A or C in any of the individual modules. We dont have GPA system for language studies.</p>

<p>This percentage is regarded with high value in my country and I was one of the top four in my class. However, there is no set grading scale used by the examiners in my country and it is very rare, in fact, almost impossible to score above 70% in any language related field. And that is the case for the most perfect performance. </p>

<p>My Bachelors scores suck (59.9%). I was disappointed in myself for not being able to get admission into a medical school(marginally) like the rest of my siblings and ending up doing Bachelors in law and English Literature was a major shock for my planned future career ( I had been a brilliant student before). I, however, slowly developed interest in Linguistics and did well in Masters.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My first question is, as most good Universities require a GPA of 3 or above with successful candidates usually having more than 3.6, what are my chances of admission? How can I go about explaining my situation as the % of students pursuing Linguistics doctorate at US from my country is very low. Are my scores too horrible?</p></li>
<li><p>My only research was Masters thesis in a literature related field, titled, 'Autobiographical element in Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ""One Hundred Years of Solitude""' of almost 40,000 words. Will it hinder my chance for admission into Linguistics?  </p></li>
<li><p>What else can I do to improve my application and up my chances specifically for Lingsuitics? How should I lay out my SOP? My ultimate preference would be Berkeley,UCLA and MIT. Should I even think about these universities with such scores?  </p></li>

Germany recognizes (properly obtained) Ph.D.s from other EU countries.
People with an EU Ph.D. are allowed to use the abbreviation ""Dr."" in front of their names without mentioning the country of origin (which is AFAIK required for some other countries) or using the original version. However, reading <a href=""http://www.stmwfk.bayern.de/Hochschule/pdf/grade.pdf"">this information letter from the Bavarian State Ministry of Sciences, Research and the Arts</a>, section 1.3.2. (German), you are not allowed to use both together.</p>

<p>I'm confused about this and its exact scope. 
Does this mean a Ph.D. holder can't call him-/herself ""Dr. Firstname Lastname"" on a business card and then list ""Ph.D."" together with the other titles like ""M.Eng., Dipl.Ing."" on a second line? Using ""Firstname Lastname, Ph.D."" in Germany would not have the same effect then the first form. Not mentioning the Ph.D. at all however would keep many people wondering what kind of doctor grade you have. Maybe it only means not to use ""Dr. Firstname Lastname, Ph.D."", but the business card example is very close to that.<br>
Also, can ""Ph.D."" be used in one occasion and then ""Dr."" in a different one, or do you have to stick with one? Would it be ok to use ""Dr."" on your German business card and ""Ph.D."" on your English one? Even if both are on opposite sides of the same card?</p>

As I have finished all coursework requirement (72 semester hours, I transfer some credits from MS), I plan to work in the company and be a part time student to finish the degree. </p>

<p>From last month, my adviser kept asked what's my plan. I told him I will make my decision in mid-July as I can know my H1b working visa is approved or not. He send me another email ( I post here for information). My impression is he is threatening me...</p>

<p>Any suggestion? Again, it's difficult to look for a job for international students in such economics. I hope I can work and study as a part time student to finish the degree.</p>

1980,"<p>I am three years into a PhD in Germany in an interdisciplinary social sciences field (Global Integration/Global Studies), but I am quite disillusioned with the faculty and the quality of guidance here. Moreover, the academic job prospects are not very good after the PhD, and any other job, given EU regulations, is hard to get (I am non EU). Going back to my country, given the corruption in academics, is also not an option. I am thinking of dropping this, and applying for PhDs in Canada or the US. Is this a good option. I would apply for single discipline such as political science. I am thinking of international business too, because my work is a policy relevant field.</p>

1983,"<p>I thought of an interesting idea for a thesis for my Masters program and I think I would eventually be able to sell a product that is built from the algorithms/code that I develop for this thesis.  I realize my thesis is my work and I have the copyright permissions, but I am wondering what rights I have and what rights my school has if I were to take my thesis and develop it into a product which I then sell to customers. </p>

<p>Would I have all rights for selling this product or since my professor is essentially guiding me and assisting me in my research, does he/she own a part of it as well?  I can only seem to find answers on the internet that pertain to the copyright permissions of the actual developed thesis, not products that might be derived from such efforts, or code that was developed in tandem with writing the thesis.</p>

<p>Any links to proof or legal precedence would be very helpful as well.</p>

1992,"<p>I feel I've received poor grades in my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering - Second Class Second Division as per UK grading system. Having finished my bachelors in the UK I wish to enroll into a masters program in Systems or Mechanical Engineering in the US. I am currently employed by a logistics company in Dubai. </p>

<p>How can I improve my chances of getting into a grad school in the US with what I consider as poor grades? What other factors can strengthen my application? </p>
