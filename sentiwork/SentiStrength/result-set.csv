In class pop (surprize) quizzes account for about 10% of the grade. I use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructure#Canvas"" rel=""nofollow"">canvas</a> for my in-class quizzes (and to collect homework assignments, start discussions).</p>

<p>The class room I teach in doesn't have computers so when I set up an pop quiz on canvas, I generally let the students out of class during the last 10 minutes to log in to one of the several campus computers to take the quiz.</p>

<p>However, I know that our computers aren't top notch and one can easily spend about 5-7 minutes just logging in and another 2-3 minutes launching a web browser to access canvas. </p>

<p>Given these technical issues (that can't be sorted out because of a lax IT department) I generally keep my quiz open for about 9 hours. This also takes into account the other classes that my students may have to rush in to right after mine which might prevent them from attempting the pop quiz until later that day.</p>

<p>Isn't this unfair to students who take the quiz immediately? By keeping my quiz open for 9 hours, it takes away the <strong>surprise</strong> component of it substantially. Is there a way I can do this without having to have quizzes on paper and in-class?</p>

<p>Should I just be mean and keep my quiz open for only the 20 minutes or so at the end of my class?</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Edit:</em> I was thinking about this and I thought of a couple of things that I'd like to add:</p>

<ol>
<li>One way to nullify this is by announcing that there would be a quiz in the next 3 days. That way, the students will try and learn and not just haphazardly flip through their textbook as I assume they would if it were a true pop quiz.</li>
<li>I could tell them that the examinations which account for 70% of the grade will be tough and it would be sensible to be honest with pop quizzes.</li>
<li>Borrowing from Zenon's comment below, why not mix multiple choice questions with single valued answers with only 1 attempt?</li>

<p>I often want to take this list of APA references (e.g., one reference per line) and import them into my bibliographic software in such a way that the reference manager is able to discern what aspects of the reference correspond to author, year, title, journal, issue, pages, etc.
I'm often working with Endnote to do this, but I imagine that once you get the data into any reference manager (e.g., Mendeley, Zotero, etc.), it would be relatively easy to export and import into a preferred reference manager.</p>

<p>I'd also be happy with a system that was pretty good but not perfect. In psychology at least, most references are journal articles, book chapters, and books. So a system that imported these and flagged the rest would still be useful.</p>

Their rough workflow seems to be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Authors submit a target article.</li>
<li>Target article is peer-reviewed as in a normal journal, with a focus on if it is of sufficient interest to warrant discussion in such a forum setting.</li>
<li>If accepted, the editors send a massive number of invitations to associates of the journal, soliciting commentary proposals on the target article. A dark-net link to the final version of the target article is included.</li>
<li>Authors submit commentary proposals, and the editors review them, selecting a subset that would make a good discussion.</li>
<li>Selected commentators write their articles and submit them to the editors</li>
<li>Editors do a quick review of commentaries and pass them on to the target article authors for a rebuttal.</li>
<li>Target article authors write a rebuttal.</li>
<li>Everything is published at the same time (this is the stage that BBS makes anything directly publicly available from their site).</li>
</ol>

<p>At stage [3], the number of commentators contacted is significantly in excess of what you would for soliciting peer review. A link to the post-review paper that is accessible without any logins is also distributed, but this link is on the 'dark net' -- nothing on the main site links directly to it. The contacted associates are encouraged to share the article with their colleagues and bring non-contacted collaborators on board if they want to write a commentary. </p>

<p>My question is: <strong>to what extent can the sharing in step [3] be taken?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Can you share the article privately as much as you want? I.e. can a non-associate that was sent the article by an associate (but not the editor) then forward it to another non-associate?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you contact the authors of the target article with questions or comments that make it obvious that you've read the article? (Note, that you wouldn't be able to do this for an article you are peer-reviewing)</p></li>
<li><p>Can you write a blog post about the article before it comes out, making a summary of it, and referencing it as (to appear)?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you share the link that was emailed to you publicly (say on your blog)?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the target authors often have a preprint of the target article linked from their website, kind of like a white paper (although it isn't always exactly the same version as is sent out by BBS).

<p>When a journal (such as one of the Nature family) asks for information about authors' contributions, what is the most effective way to answer this, to ensure that the co-authorship is assigned as intended, and to ensure that reality is represented: that <strong>the work is a product of the intellectual environment of the whole team; and that all members have contributed in various degrees to the analytical methods used, to the research concept, and to the experiment design</strong>. Is what I've just written there sufficient, or is there a more judicious phrasing that is accepted by heavyweight journal publishers such as the Nature Group?</p>

<h3>The context</h3>

<p>The primary context is publications from a team that works on the principle that all members of the team are to be named authors on all papers coming out of the team.</p>

<p><strong>I'm very specifically looking for answers from editors who handle such papers; or from members of teams with similar rules.</strong> Answers from others are of course possible, but I'd value direct personal experience.</p>

<p>Here's the <a href=""http://www.icmje.org/ethical_1author.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Vancouver Group's (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors) statement on the subject</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Authorship credit should be based on 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published. Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3.</p>
  
  <p>When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should identify the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript. These individuals should fully meet the criteria for authorship/contributorship defined above, and editors will ask these individuals to complete journal-specific author and conflict-of-interest disclosure forms. When submitting a manuscript authored by a group, the corresponding author should clearly indicate the preferred citation and identify all individual authors as well as the group name. Journals generally list other members of the group in the Acknowledgments. The NLM indexes the group name and the names of individuals the group has identified as being directly responsible for the manuscript; it also lists the names of collaborators if they are listed in Acknowledgments.</p>
  
  <p>Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research group alone does not constitute authorship.</p>
  
  <p>All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify should be listed.</p>
  
  <p>Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><sub> 1. My field is not medicine: I've used the Vancouver Group's guidelines, as I haven't yet found any in my field.</sub></p>

<p>For example, listing a past position of <code>department chair</code> indicates administrative duties at department level, but it depends on the department. Definitely, chairing a small department with a few faculty members and annual enrollment of 30 undergraduate students is different from a well-funded department with tens of senior faculty members and several PhD programs. However, if a reader does not know that specific department, the term <code>department chair</code> is the same.</p>

<p>This is even more serious when it comes to differences in terminology. In a university, a faculty can be equal to a department, and somewhere else a faculty can be in the size of a university hosting several large departments.

To decide whether a particular piece of data X is a good admissions criterion, people seem to focus on how well X correlates with college grades. (This may be freshman grades or total college GPA. Some people think  success in getting a degree would be more appropriate. For the purposes of this question, I don't think these distinctions are relevant.)</p>

<p>Isn't this correlation a completely incorrect way of evaluating X as a tool for admissions?</p>

<p>It seems like an apples-to-oranges comparison. A student who has low X is admitted to a nonselective school, where standards are low and they compete with other low-X students. Grades at this school measure how well they did based on the low standards prevailing there. Students who have high X are admitted to a selective school. A ""B"" grade at Berkeley is not the same as a ""B"" grade at Cal State Dominguez Hills. A high-X student goes to Berkeley and gets a ""B"" in calculus. A low-X student goes to CSDH and gets a ""B"" in calculus. This shows up in the statistics as a lack of correlation between X and grades, since the students differed in X but got the same grade. But isn't that misleading, since the grades mean different things at the two schools?</p>

<p><strong>Is there any known number or record on how frequently (let's say, across North America) assistant professors who don't have tenure yet switch institutions?</strong></p>

<p>The market is already incredibly competitive. The academic institution has spent thousands of dollars on hiring a candidate and wants to retain them. If an assistant professor goes to another school and gets hired, then what you might end up with is this cycle of highly-ranking candidates swirling around and leaving empty positions in their wake. Alternatively, one might presume that the hiring system must be inefficient if, in a competitive environment, a university is unable to retain its hires.</p>

This worked well for a while.</p>

<p>But now (more recently) I find that I again have a back-log of promising topics that have exceeded my capacity to even advise/delegate. I have no students to work on them. The ideas are mixed in quality, concreteness, promise, etc. and I'm saving some of the ones I am most interested in for myself or for students. But I know that there are others I will have to neglect (and I often choose the ""safer"" topics since being in tenure-track, I have a constant hunger for publications).</p>

<p>Now I have a text file on my hard-drive with a list of sketches of ideas so that I remember them. But a lot of the details are left unexpressed in my head; most of the ideas in the text file would be pretty meaningless in their current form without some explanation, further development, context and/or motivation from me. At the same time, I have sufficient experience to know that there are interesting paper/thesis topics in there that I could help develop and/or advise if I had the time/money.</p>

I sometimes wonder if other professors similarly have lists of research topics that just rot away in a text file somewhere. It would seem like such a waste if this were the case: think about the union of all these text files sitting on local hard-drives!

Ultimately the majority of the points you lost were not for using this incorrect method (the TAs error), it was for not interpreting your answer and realizing it made no sense.

I would like to judge how common it is for universities to give course reductions for service on dissertation committees.</p>

<p>Two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does your university offer such reductions for the advisor, readers, examiners?</li>
<li>How generous is the reduction? (1/3 of a course, 1/4 of a course, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Please include your discipline and location in the reply so we can get a more robust picture.</p>

<p>For instance: USA, Philosophy, 1/2 course for the dissertation advisor, 1/3 course for the readers, 0 for the examiners.</p>

The aim of the lab is <em>not</em> to teach them any particular technical skills. It's only meant to supplement the <em>content</em> of the course by exposing them to some more advanced concepts in a hands-on way. The lab itself is the means, not the goal.</p>

<p>So beyond a single ""orientation"" lab, they don't get a whole lot of training in debugging things that go wrong in the lab, and I don't expect them to become advanced users of the lab infrastructure. They're encouraged to post questions on a course forum if they have trouble running a lab exercise, and I answer their questions there.</p>

<p>Having said that, some students post questions that would be closed immediately on a Stack Exchange site for lack of detail, and for good reason. Questions like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can't log in to the website, please help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I run the experiment, it gives me an error. Can somebody help me???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can't see the results of the experiment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>with no further details. These are perfectly reasonable things to ask about, but the student hasn't even attempted to give me any details as to what went wrong. In the ""real world,"" people that ask questions like this won't usually get help.</p>

<p>Since I operate the computing infrastructure for the lab, I can actually find out the specifics of what happened by checking the student's username against the server logs. So I can give them an answer even if they ask a really incomplete question (e.g., I can check the server logs and see that their experiment failed because they mistyped a command).</p>

<p>But I'm not sure if I should answer their questions (because I can, and I want to encourage them to ask questions if they have trouble), or if I should try to train them to ask better questions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On the one hand: it seems like I am doing them a disservice by not teaching them how to ask for help properly.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand: students are (legitimately) frustrated when they're using infrastructure they haven't been extensively trained in, and they can't get it to work. If I try to get them to ask better questions, they'll feel like I'm being deliberately unhelpful and making them jump through hoops to get an answer to their question. (I know this because that's been their reaction the few times I tried this.) They may stop asking questions and just give up on the lab exercises.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Should I risk the actual course goal (delivering content to the students) in favor of a general educational goal (teaching them how to ask questions)?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to train students to ask better questions without making them feel like I'm not helping them?</strong></p>

<p>Just to clarify: I already provide answers to commonly asked questions, and a lot of material to help students formulate better questions <em>before</em> they ask. Some students ignore that material and ask very non-specific questions anyways. My question is how to address this once they've asked the question: should I walk them through the process of reformulating it before I answer? Is there a way to do so without frustrating them further?</p>
